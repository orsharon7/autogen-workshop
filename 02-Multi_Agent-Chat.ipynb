      "### Abstract of the Paper\n",
      "> In this paper, we introduce MoRSE (Mixture of RAGs Security Experts), the first specialised AI chatbot for cybersecurity. MoRSE aims to provide comprehensive and complete knowledge about cybersecurity. MoRSE uses two RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems designed to retrieve and organize information from multidimensional cybersecurity contexts. MoRSE differs from traditional RAGs by using parallel retrievers that work together to retrieve semantically related information in different formats and structures. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on Parametric Knowledge Bases, MoRSE retrieves relevant documents from Non-Parametric Knowledge Bases in response to user queries. Subsequently, MoRSE uses this information to generate accurate answers. In addition, MoRSE benefits from real-time updates to its knowledge bases, enabling continuous knowledge enrichment without retraining. We have evaluated the effectiveness of MoRSE against other state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the system on 600 cybersecurity specific questions. The experimental evaluation has shown that the improvement in terms of relevance and correctness of the answer is more than 10% compared to known solutions such as GPT-4 and Mixtral 7x8.\n",

MoRSE aims to provide comprehensive and complete knowledge about cybersecurity. MoRSE uses two RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems designed to retrieve and organize information from multidimensional cybersecurity contexts. MoRSE differs from traditional RAGs by using parallel retrievers that work together to retrieve semantically related information in different formats and structures. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on Parametric Knowledge Bases, MoRSE retrieves relevant documents from Non-Parametric Knowledge Bases in response to user queries. Subsequently, MoRSE uses this information to generate accurate answers. In addition, MoRSE benefits from real-time updates to its knowledge bases, enabling continuous knowledge enrichment without retraining. We have evaluated the effectiveness of MoRSE against other state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the system on 600 cybersecurity specific questions. The experimental evaluation has shown that the improvement in terms of relevance and correctness of the answer is more than 10% compared to known solutions such as GPT-4 and Mixtral 7x8.\\n\\n### Potential Applications in Software\\n\\n1. **Cybersecurity Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**:\\n   - **Helpdesk Support**: MoRSE can be integrated into helpdesk systems to provide real-time support and guidance to users facing cybersecurity issues.\\n   - **Training Tools**: Organizations can use MoRSE to train employees on cybersecurity best practices and simulate phishing attacks or other cyber threats.\\n\\n2. **Real-time Cyber Threat Intelligence**:\\n   - **Monitoring Tools**: Integrate MoRSE into cybersecurity monitoring tools to provide real-time threat intelligence and alert users about potential vulnerabilities and threats.\\n   - **Incident Response**: Use MoRSE to assist incident response teams by providing quick access to relevant information on emerging threats and suggesting remediation steps.\\n\\n3. **Knowledge Management Systems**:\\n   - **Dynamic Knowledge Bases**: Incorporate MoRSE into knowledge management systems to maintain a continuously updated, non-parametric knowledge base that benefits from real-time updates.\\n\\n4. **Security Audits and Compliance**:\\n   - **Automated Audits**: Leverage MoRSE to automate the auditing process by retrieving and analyzing relevant compliance documents and security policies.\\n   - **Policy Enforcement**: MoRSE can assist in enforcing organizational security policies by providing timely recommendations based on current threats and best practices.\\n\\n5. **Developer Tools**:\\n   - **Secure Coding Assistants**: Develop plugins for IDEs that use MoRSE to assist developers in writing secure code by suggesting fixes for potential vulnerabilities and providing secure coding guidelines.\\n   - **Code Review Tools**: Integrate MoRSE into code review tools to automatically identify and flag security vulnerabilities in the codebase.\\n\\n6. **Educational Platforms**:\\n   - **Learning Management Systems**: Integrate MoRSE into educational platforms to provide students with instant access to cybersecurity resources and answer their questions accurately.\\n   - **Cybersecurity Courses**: Use MoRSE to create interactive and adaptive learning experiences in cybersecurity courses, offering personalized assistance and feedback to learners.\\n\\n7. **API Services**:\\n   - **Cybersecurity-as-a-Service**: Offer MoRSE-powered APIs for third-party applications to integrate advanced cybersecurity query handling and threat intelligence capabilities.\\n\\nThese applications demonstrate how the advancements detailed in the MoRSE paper can be integrated into various software solutions to enhance cybersecurity measures, offer more robust user support, and provide real-time, accurate information across multiple contexts.', 'name': 'Product_manager', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'TERMINATE', 'name': 'Coder', 'role': 'user'}], summary='', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0}}, human_input=[])"

      "The plan is well-structured and covers all necessary steps to achieve the task. However, there are a few areas that need improvement or clarification:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
      "   - The current query might not be specific enough to capture only LLM-related papers. Consider refining the search query to include more specific terms or combinations.\n",
      "   - Ensure that the query includes a date range filter to capture papers from the last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Filtering**:\n",
      "   - The filtering logic should be more robust. Instead of just checking the title, consider also checking the abstract for relevant keywords.\n",
      "   - Include additional metadata such as authors, publication date, and a direct link to the paper for better context.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Domain Classification**:\n",
      "   - Manual classification can be time-consuming. Consider using a predefined list of domains and a simple keyword matching algorithm to automate the initial classification, followed by manual review.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Markdown Table Creation**:\n",
      "   - Include additional columns in the markdown table for better clarity, such as authors, publication date, and a link to the paper.\n",
      "   - Ensure that the table is properly formatted and easy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review and Finalize**:\n",

      "\n",
      "The implementation successfully fetched, filtered, classified, and generated a markdown table of recent arXiv papers on LLM applications. The table is well-structured and includes relevant information such as title, authors, domain, and a link to the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Positive Aspects:\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive Data Collection**: The script effectively collects data from arXiv using specific keywords.\n",
      "2. **Accurate Filtering**: The filtering mechanism ensures that only relevant papers are included.\n",
      "3. **Domain Classification**: The classification into domains is logical and helps in organizing the information.\n",
      "4. **Markdown Table**: The table is clear and includes all necessary details.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "1. **Domain Classification**: Some papers classified under \"Education\" might be better suited for other domains. For example, \"Evaluating Large Language Models for Anxiety and Depression Classification using Counseling and Psychotherapy Transcripts\" could be classified under \"Healthcare\".\n",
      "2. **Additional Domains**: Consider adding more domains to better categorize the papers. For instance, \"Social Sciences\" or \"Natural Language Processing\".\n",
      "3. **Abstract Inclusion**: Including a brief abstract or summary in the table could provide more context for each paper.\n",
      "4. **Automated Classification**: While manual classification is accurate, an automated approach using NLP techniques could save time and improve scalability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Refine Domain Classification**:\n",
      "   - Review the domain classification and adjust as necessary.\n",
      "   - Add more domains to better categorize the papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Include Abstracts**:\n",
      "   - Modify the table to include a brief abstract or summary for each paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Automate Classification**:\n",
      "   - Implement an automated classification system using NLP techniques to categorize papers based on their content.\n",
      "\n",

However, there are a few areas that need improvement or clarification:\\n\\n1. **Data Collection**:\\n   - The current query might not be specific enough to capture only LLM-related papers. Consider refining the search query to include more specific terms or combinations.\\n   - Ensure that the query includes a date range filter to capture papers from the last week.\\n\\n2. **Data Filtering**:\\n   - The filtering logic should be more robust. Instead of just checking the title, consider also checking the abstract for relevant keywords.\\n   - Include additional metadata such as authors, publication date, and a direct link to the paper for better context.\\n\\n3. **Domain Classification**:\\n   - Manual classification can be time-consuming. Consider using a predefined list of domains and a simple keyword matching algorithm to automate the initial classification, followed by manual review.\\n\\n4. **Markdown Table Creation**:\\n   - Include additional columns in the markdown table for better clarity, such as authors, publication date, and a link to the paper.\\n   - Ensure that the table is properly formatted and easy to read.\\n\\n5. **Review and Finalize**:\\n   - Include a step to verify the accuracy of the data and the classification before finalizing the markdown table.\\n\\n### Revised Plan\\n\\n1. **Data Collection**\\n   - **Scientist**: Define more specific keywords and search criteria.\\n   - **Engineer**: Use Python to interact with the arXiv API and collect papers from the last week.\\n     ```python\\n     import requests\\n     from datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\n     def fetch_arxiv_papers(keywords, days=7):\\n         base_url = \"http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?\"\\n         end_date = datetime.now()\\n         start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=days)\\n         query = f\"search_query=all:{\\'+OR+\\'.join(keywords)}+AND+submittedDate:[{start_date.strftime(\\'%Y%m%d\\')}+TO+{end_date.strftime(\\'%Y%m%d\\')}]&start=0&max_results=100\"\\n         response = requests.get(base_url + query)\\n         return response.text\\n\\n     keywords = [\"LLM\", \"Large Language Model\", \"GPT\", \"BERT\"]\\n     papers = fetch_arxiv_papers(keywords)\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Data Filtering**\\n   - **Engineer**: Parse the XML response and filter papers related to LLM applications.\\n     ```python\\n     import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\\n\\n     def filter_papers(xml_data):\\n         root = ET.fromstring(xml_data)\\n         papers = []\\n         for entry in root.findall(\"{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}entry\"):\\n             title = entry.find(\"{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}title\").text\\n             summary = entry.find(\"{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}summary\").text\\n             authors = [author.find(\"{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}name\").text for author in entry.findall(\"{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}author\")]\\n             link = entry.find(\"{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}id\").text\\n             if any(keyword in title or keyword in summary for keyword in keywords):\\n                 papers.append({\"title\": title, \"summary\": summary, \"authors\": authors, \"link\": link})\\n         return papers\\n\\n     filtered_papers = filter_papers(papers)\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Domain Classification**\\n   - **Scientist**: Define a list of domains and keywords for classification.\\n   - **Engineer**: Implement a simple keyword matching algorithm for initial classification.\\n     ```python\\n     domains = {\\n         \"Healthcare\": [\"health\", \"medical\", \"clinical\"],\\n         \"Finance\": [\"finance\", \"financial\", \"market\"],\\n         \"Education\": [\"education\", \"learning\", \"teaching\"],\\n         # Add more domains and keywords as needed\\n     }\\n\\n     def classify_papers(papers, domains):\\n         for paper in papers:\\n             paper[\"domain\"] = \"Other\"\\n             for domain, keywords in domains.items():\\n                 if any(keyword in paper[\"summary\"].lower() for keyword in keywords):\\n                     paper[\"domain\"] = domain\\n                     break\\n         return papers\\n\\n     classified_papers = classify_papers(filtered_papers, domains)\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Markdown Table Creation**\\n   - **Engineer**: Write a script to generate a markdown table with additional columns.\\n     ```python\\n     def create_markdown_table(papers):\\n         table = \"| Title | Authors | Domain | Link |\\\\n|-------|---------|--------|------|\\\\n\"\\n         for paper in papers:\\n             authors = \", \".join(paper[\"authors\"])\\n             table += f\"| {paper[\\'title\\']} | {authors} | {paper[\\'domain\\']} | [Link]({paper[\\'link\\']}) |\\\\n\"\\n         return table\\n\\n     markdown_table = create_markdown_table(classified_papers)\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Review and Finalize**\\n   - **Scientist**: Review the markdown table for completeness and accuracy.\\n   - **Engineer**: Make necessary adjustments based on feedback.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n1.

Subsequently, different LLMs such as GPT\\nmodels from OpenAI have been released. These models perform well on diverse\\ntasks and have been gaining widespread applications in fields such as business\\nand education. However, little is known about the opportunities and challenges\\nof using LLMs in the construction industry. Thus, this study aims to assess GPT\\nmodels in the construction industry. A critical review, expert discussion and\\ncase study validation are employed to achieve the study objectives. The\\nfindings revealed opportunities for GPT models throughout the project\\nlifecycle. The challenges of leveraging GPT models are highlighted and a use\\ncase prototype is developed for materials selection and optimization. The\\nfindings of the study would be of benefit to researchers, practitioners and\\nstakeholders, as it presents research vistas for LLMs in the construction\\nindustry.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPT-RE: In-context Learning for Relation Extraction using Large Language\\n  Models\\nSummary:   In spite of the potential for ground-breaking achievements offered by large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) (e.g., GPT-3), they still lag significantly behind\\nfully-supervised baselines (e.g., fine-tuned BERT) in relation extraction (RE).\\nThis is due to the two major shortcomings of LLMs in RE: (1) low relevance\\nregarding entity and relation in retrieved demonstrations for in-context\\nlearning; and (2) the strong inclination to wrongly classify NULL examples into\\nother pre-defined labels.\\n  In this paper, we propose GPT-RE to bridge the gap between LLMs and\\nfully-supervised baselines. GPT-RE successfully addresses the aforementioned\\nissues by (1) incorporating task-specific entity representations in\\ndemonstration retrieval; and (2) enriching the demonstrations with gold\\nlabel-induced reasoning logic. We evaluate GPT-RE on four widely-used RE\\ndatasets, and observe that GPT-RE achieves improvements over not only existing\\nGPT-3 baselines, but also fully-supervised baselines. Specifically, GPT-RE\\nachieves SOTA performances on the Semeval and SciERC datasets, and competitive\\nperformances on the TACRED and ACE05 datasets.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Sim-GPT: Text Similarity via GPT Annotated Data\\nSummary:   Due to the lack of a large collection of high-quality labeled sentence pairs\\nwith textual similarity scores, existing approaches for Semantic Textual\\nSimilarity (STS) mostly rely on unsupervised techniques or training signals\\nthat are only partially correlated with textual similarity, e.g., NLI-based\\ndatasets. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose the strategy of\\nmeasuring text similarity via GPT annotated data (Sim-GPT for short). The core\\nidea of Sim-GPT is to generate data with STS labels using GPT-4, based on which\\nan STS model is trained. Sim-GPT framework utilizes LLMs to provide a\\nsubstantial amount of reliable annotated data filling the gap of the lack of\\ntraining signals for STS. Sim-GPT is trained on a one-time generated dataset\\nusing BERT or RoBERTa as the backbone, which offers long-term savings in cost\\nand speed compared to repeatedly invoking LLMs for each sentence pair. Trained\\non the examples from GPT-4 (371K), Sim-GPT yields SOTA performances on the\\nwidely-used seven STS benchmarks: +0.99 over supervised-SimCSE, and +0.42 over\\nthe current SOTA PromCSE model. To encourage further advancements of the field,\\nwe release both models and the 371K annotated examples from GPT-4. Code, models\\nand annotated data are available at: https://github.com/ShuheWang1998/Sim-GPT.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Exploring the Reversal Curse and Other Deductive Logical Reasoning in\\n  BERT and GPT-Based Large Language Models\\nSummary:   The term \"Reversal Curse\" refers to the scenario where auto-regressive\\ndecoder large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, trained on \"A is B\" fail\\nto learn \"B is A,\" assuming that B and A are distinct and can be uniquely\\nidentified from each other, demonstrating a basic failure of logical deduction.\\nThis raises a red flag in the use of GPT models for certain general tasks such\\nas constructing knowledge graphs, considering their adherence to this symmetric\\nprinciple. In our study, we examined a bidirectional LLM, BERT, and found that\\nit is immune to the reversal curse. Driven by ongoing efforts to construct\\nbiomedical knowledge graphs with LLMs, we also embarked on evaluating more\\ncomplex but essential deductive reasoning capabilities. This process included\\nfirst training encoder and decoder language models to master the intersection\\nand union operations on two sets and then moving on to assess their capability\\nto infer different combinations of union and intersection operations on three\\nnewly created sets. The findings showed that while both encoder and decoder\\nlanguage models, trained for tasks involving two sets (union/intersection),\\nwere proficient in such scenarios, they encountered difficulties when dealing\\nwith operations that included three sets (various combinations of union and\\nintersection). Our research highlights the distinct characteristics of encoder\\nand decoder models in simple and complex logical reasoning. In practice, the\\nchoice between BERT and GPT should be guided by the specific requirements and\\nnature of the task at hand, leveraging their respective strengths in\\nbidirectional context comprehension and sequence prediction.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPT-MolBERTa: GPT Molecular Features Language Model for molecular\\n  property prediction\\nSummary:   With the emergence of Transformer architectures and their powerful\\nunderstanding of textual data, a new horizon has opened up to predict the\\nmolecular properties based on text description. While SMILES are the most\\ncommon form of representation, they are lacking robustness, rich information\\nand canonicity, which limit their effectiveness in becoming generalizable\\nrepresentations. Here, we present GPT-MolBERTa, a self-supervised large\\nlanguage model (LLM) which uses detailed textual descriptions of molecules to\\npredict their properties. A text based description of 326000 molecules were\\ncollected using ChatGPT and used to train LLM to learn the representation of\\nmolecules. To predict the properties for the downstream tasks, both BERT and\\nRoBERTa models were used in the finetuning stage. Experiments show that\\nGPT-MolBERTa performs well on various molecule property benchmarks, and\\napproaching state of the art performance in regression tasks. Additionally,\\nfurther analysis of the attention mechanisms show that GPT-MolBERTa is able to\\npick up important information from the input textual data, displaying the\\ninterpretability of the model.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Conceptor-Aided Debiasing of Large Language Models\\nSummary:   Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) reflect the inherent social biases\\nof their training corpus. Many methods have been proposed to mitigate this\\nissue, but they often fail to debias or they sacrifice model accuracy. We use\\nconceptors--a soft projection method--to identify and remove the bias subspace\\nin LLMs such as BERT and GPT. We propose two methods of applying conceptors (1)\\nbias subspace projection by post-processing by the conceptor NOT operation; and\\n(2) a new architecture, conceptor-intervened BERT (CI-BERT), which explicitly\\nincorporates the conceptor projection into all layers during training. We find\\nthat conceptor post-processing achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) debiasing\\nresults while maintaining LLMs\\' performance on the GLUE benchmark. Further, it\\nis robust in various scenarios and can mitigate intersectional bias efficiently\\nby its AND operation on the existing bias subspaces. Although CI-BERT\\'s\\ntraining takes all layers\\' bias into account and can beat its post-processing\\ncounterpart in bias mitigation, CI-BERT reduces the language model accuracy. We\\nalso show the importance of carefully constructing the bias subspace. The best\\nresults are obtained by removing outliers from the list of biased words,\\ncombining them (via the OR operation), and computing their embeddings using the\\nsentences from a cleaner corpus.\\n\\n\\nTitle: FoundationLayerNorm: Scaling BERT and GPT to 1,000 Layers\\nSummary:   The mainstream BERT/GPT model contains only 10 to 20 layers, and there is\\nlittle literature to discuss the training of deep BERT/GPT. This paper proposes\\na simple yet effective method to stabilize BERT and GPT training. We\\nsuccessfully scale up BERT and GPT to 1,000 layers, which is an order of\\nmagnitude deeper than previous BERT and GPT. The proposed method\\nFoundationLayerNormalization enables efficient training of deep neural networks\\nand is validated at the 1000-layer scale.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Annotation Guidelines-Based Knowledge Augmentation: Towards Enhancing\\n  Large Language Models for Educational Text Classification\\nSummary:   Various machine learning approaches have gained significant popularity for\\nthe automated classification of educational text to identify indicators of\\nlearning engagement -- i.e. learning engagement classification (LEC). LEC can\\noffer comprehensive insights into human learning processes, attracting\\nsignificant interest from diverse research communities, including Natural\\nLanguage Processing (NLP), Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining.\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated\\nremarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their comprehensive\\nevaluation and improvement approaches in LEC tasks have not been thoroughly\\ninvestigated. In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based\\nKnowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to\\nretrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then\\napplies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples.\\nSubsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which\\nincludes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and\\nurgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and\\ncognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results\\ndemonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and\\nLlama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models\\nsuch as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT\\n4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex\\nsemantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination\\nbased on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source\\nGPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels\\nwith similar names in multi-class classification.\\n\\n\\nTitle: BERT vs GPT for financial engineering\\nSummary:   The paper benchmarks several Transformer models [4], to show how these models\\ncan judge sentiment from a news event. This signal can then be used for\\ndownstream modelling and signal identification for commodity trading. We find\\nthat fine-tuned BERT models outperform fine-tuned or vanilla GPT models on this\\ntask. Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language\\nprocessing (NLP) in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results on various\\ntasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and\\nnatural language generation. Among the most prominent transformer models are\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative\\nPre-trained Transformer (GPT), which differ in their architectures and\\nobjectives.\\n  A CopBERT model training data and process overview is provided. The CopBERT\\nmodel outperforms similar domain specific BERT trained models such as FinBERT.\\nThe below confusion matrices show the performance on CopBERT & CopGPT\\nrespectively. We see a ~10 percent increase in f1_score when compare CopBERT vs\\nGPT4 and 16 percent increase vs CopGPT. Whilst GPT4 is dominant It highlights\\nthe importance of considering alternatives to GPT models for financial\\nengineering tasks, given risks of hallucinations, and challenges with\\ninterpretability. We unsurprisingly see the larger LLMs outperform the BERT\\nmodels, with predictive power. In summary BERT is partially the new XGboost,\\nwhat it lacks in predictive power it provides with higher levels of\\ninterpretability. Concluding that BERT models might not be the next XGboost\\n[2], but represent an interesting alternative for financial engineering tasks,\\nthat require a blend of interpretability and accuracy.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Enhancing Phenotype Recognition in Clinical Notes Using Large Language\\n  Models: PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT\\nSummary:   We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer\\narchitecture can enable automated detection of clinical phenotype terms,\\nincluding terms not documented in the HPO. In this study, we developed two\\ntypes of models: PhenoBCBERT, a BERT-based model, utilizing Bio+Clinical BERT\\nas its pre-trained model, and PhenoGPT, a GPT-based model that can be\\ninitialized from diverse GPT models, including open-source versions such as\\nGPT-J, Falcon, and LLaMA, as well as closed-source versions such as GPT-3 and\\nGPT-3.5. We compared our methods with PhenoTagger, a recently developed HPO\\nrecognition tool that combines rule-based and deep learning methods. We found\\nthat our methods can extract more phenotype concepts, including novel ones not\\ncharacterized by HPO. We also performed case studies on biomedical literature\\nto illustrate how new phenotype information can be recognized and extracted. We\\ncompared current BERT-based versus GPT-based models for phenotype tagging, in\\nmultiple aspects including model architecture, memory usage, speed, accuracy,\\nand privacy protection. We also discussed the addition of a negation step and\\nan HPO normalization layer to the transformer models for improved HPO term\\ntagging. In conclusion, PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT enable the automated discovery\\nof phenotype terms from clinical notes and biomedical literature, facilitating\\nautomated downstream tasks to derive new biological insights on human diseases.\\n\\n\\nTitle: A Comprehensive Study on NLP Data Augmentation for Hate Speech\\n  Detection: Legacy Methods, BERT, and LLMs\\nSummary:   The surge of interest in data augmentation within the realm of NLP has been\\ndriven by the need to address challenges posed by hate speech domains, the\\ndynamic nature of social media vocabulary, and the demands for large-scale\\nneural networks requiring extensive training data. However, the prevalent use\\nof lexical substitution in data augmentation has raised concerns, as it may\\ninadvertently alter the intended meaning, thereby impacting the efficacy of\\nsupervised machine learning models. In pursuit of suitable data augmentation\\nmethods, this study explores both established legacy approaches and\\ncontemporary practices such as Large Language Models (LLM), including GPT in\\nHate Speech detection. Additionally, we propose an optimized utilization of\\nBERT-based encoder models with contextual cosine similarity filtration,\\nexposing significant limitations in prior synonym substitution methods. Our\\ncomparative analysis encompasses five popular augmentation techniques: WordNet\\nand Fast-Text synonym replacement, Back-translation, BERT-mask contextual\\naugmentation, and LLM. Our analysis across five benchmarked datasets revealed\\nthat while traditional methods like back-translation show low label alteration\\nrates (0.3-1.5%), and BERT-based contextual synonym replacement offers sentence\\ndiversity but at the cost of higher label alteration rates (over 6%). Our\\nproposed BERT-based contextual cosine similarity filtration markedly reduced\\nlabel alteration to just 0.05%, demonstrating its efficacy in 0.7% higher F1\\nperformance. However, augmenting data with GPT-3 not only avoided overfitting\\nwith up to sevenfold data increase but also improved embedding space coverage\\nby 15% and classification F1 score by 1.4% over traditional methods, and by\\n0.8% over our method.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Utilizing Large Language Models to Generate Synthetic Data to Increase\\n  the Performance of BERT-Based Neural Networks\\nSummary:   An important issue impacting healthcare is a lack of available experts.\\nMachine learning (ML) models could resolve this by aiding in diagnosing\\npatients. However, creating datasets large enough to train these models is\\nexpensive. We evaluated large language models (LLMs) for data creation. Using\\nAutism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), we prompted ChatGPT and GPT-Premium to\\ngenerate 4,200 synthetic observations to augment existing medical data. Our\\ngoal is to label behaviors corresponding to autism criteria and improve model\\naccuracy with synthetic training data. We used a BERT classifier pre-trained on\\nbiomedical literature to assess differences in performance between models. A\\nrandom sample (N=140) from the LLM-generated data was evaluated by a clinician\\nand found to contain 83% correct example-label pairs. Augmenting data increased\\nrecall by 13% but decreased precision by 16%, correlating with higher quality\\nand lower accuracy across pairs. Future work will analyze how different\\nsynthetic data traits affect ML outcomes.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Federated Large Language Models\\nSummary:   With the rapid adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as the training and tuning\\nprotocol for applications utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), recent\\nresearch highlights the need for significant modifications to FL to accommodate\\nthe large-scale of LLMs. While substantial adjustments to the protocol have\\nbeen introduced as a response, comprehensive privacy analysis for the adapted\\nFL protocol is currently lacking.\\n  To address this gap, our work delves into an extensive examination of the\\nprivacy analysis of FL when used for training LLMs, both from theoretical and\\npractical perspectives. In particular, we design two active membership\\ninference attacks with guaranteed theoretical success rates to assess the\\nprivacy leakages of various adapted FL configurations. Our theoretical findings\\nare translated into practical attacks, revealing substantial privacy\\nvulnerabilities in popular LLMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and\\nOpenAI\\'s GPTs, across multiple real-world language datasets. Additionally, we\\nconduct thorough experiments to evaluate the privacy leakage of these models\\nwhen data is protected by state-of-the-art differential privacy (DP)\\nmechanisms.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Auto-GPT for Online Decision Making: Benchmarks and Additional Opinions\\nSummary:   Auto-GPT is an autonomous agent that leverages recent advancements in\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making tasks. While there\\nhas been a growing interest in Auto-GPT stypled agents, questions remain\\nregarding the effectiveness and flexibility of Auto-GPT in solving real-world\\ndecision-making tasks. Its limited capability for real-world engagement and the\\nabsence of benchmarks contribute to these uncertainties. In this paper, we\\npresent a comprehensive benchmark study of Auto-GPT styled agents in\\ndecision-making tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. Our aim is to gain\\ndeeper insights into this problem and understand the adaptability of GPT-based\\nagents. We compare the performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5,\\nClaude, and Vicuna in Auto-GPT styled decision-making tasks. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce the Additional Opinions algorithm, an easy and effective method that\\nincorporates supervised/imitation-based learners into the Auto-GPT scheme. This\\napproach enables lightweight supervised learning without requiring fine-tuning\\nof the foundational LLMs. We demonstrate through careful baseline comparisons\\nand ablation studies that the Additional Opinions algorithm significantly\\nenhances performance in online decision-making benchmarks, including WebShop\\nand ALFWorld.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPTs Window Shopping: An analysis of the Landscape of Custom ChatGPT\\n  Models\\nSummary:   OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT initiated a wave of technical iterations in the space of\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) by demonstrating the capability and disruptive\\npower of LLMs. OpenAI has prompted large organizations to respond with their\\nown advancements and models to push the LLM performance envelope. OpenAI has\\nprompted large organizations to respond with their own advancements and models\\nto push the LLM performance envelope. OpenAI\\'s success in spotlighting AI can\\nbe partially attributed to decreased barriers to entry, enabling any individual\\nwith an internet-enabled device to interact with LLMs. What was previously\\nrelegated to a few researchers and developers with necessary computing\\nresources is now available to all. A desire to customize LLMs to better\\naccommodate individual needs prompted OpenAI\\'s creation of the GPT Store, a\\ncentral platform where users can create and share custom GPT models.\\nCustomization comes in the form of prompt-tuning, analysis of reference\\nresources, browsing, and external API interactions, alongside a promise of\\nrevenue sharing for created custom GPTs. In this work, we peer into the window\\nof the GPT Store and measure its impact. Our analysis constitutes a large-scale\\noverview of the store exploring community perception, GPT details, and the GPT\\nauthors, in addition to a deep-dive into a 3rd party storefront indexing\\nuser-submitted GPTs, exploring if creators seek to monetize their creations in\\nthe absence of OpenAI\\'s revenue sharing.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Targeted Visualization of the Backbone of Encoder LLMs\\nSummary:   Attention based Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art in\\nnatural language processing (NLP). The two most common architectures are\\nencoders such as BERT, and decoders like the GPT models. Despite the success of\\nencoder models, on which we focus in this work, they also bear several risks,\\nincluding issues with bias or their susceptibility for adversarial attacks,\\nsignifying the necessity for explainable AI to detect such issues. While there\\ndoes exist various local explainability methods focusing on the prediction of\\nsingle inputs, global methods based on dimensionality reduction for\\nclassification inspection, which have emerged in other domains and that go\\nfurther than just using t-SNE in the embedding space, are not widely spread in\\nNLP.\\n  To reduce this gap, we investigate the application of DeepView, a method for\\nvisualizing a part of the decision function together with a data set in two\\ndimensions, to the NLP domain. While in previous work, DeepView has been used\\nto inspect deep image classification models, we demonstrate how to apply it to\\nBERT-based NLP classifiers and investigate its usability in this domain,\\nincluding settings with adversarially perturbed input samples and pre-trained,\\nfine-tuned, and multi-task models.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Log Analysis, Security, and\\n  Interpretation\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLM) continue to demonstrate their utility in a\\nvariety of emergent capabilities in different fields. An area that could\\nbenefit from effective language understanding in cybersecurity is the analysis\\nof log files. This work explores LLMs with different architectures (BERT,\\nRoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-Neo) that are benchmarked for their\\ncapacity to better analyze application and system log files for security.\\nSpecifically, 60 fine-tuned language models for log analysis are deployed and\\nbenchmarked. The resulting models demonstrate that they can be used to perform\\nlog analysis effectively with fine-tuning being particularly important for\\nappropriate domain adaptation to specific log types. The best-performing\\nfine-tuned sequence classification model (DistilRoBERTa) outperforms the\\ncurrent state-of-the-art; with an average F1-Score of 0.998 across six datasets\\nfrom both web application and system log sources. To achieve this, we propose\\nand implement a new experimentation pipeline (LLM4Sec) which leverages LLMs for\\nlog analysis experimentation, evaluation, and analysis.\\n\\n\\nTitle: FinVis-GPT: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Financial Chart\\n  Analysis\\nSummary:   In this paper, we propose FinVis-GPT, a novel multimodal large language model\\n(LLM) specifically designed for financial chart analysis. By leveraging the\\npower of LLMs and incorporating instruction tuning and multimodal capabilities,\\nFinVis-GPT is capable of interpreting financial charts and providing valuable\\nanalysis. To train FinVis-GPT, a financial task oriented dataset was generated\\nfor pre-training alignment and instruction tuning, comprising various types of\\nfinancial charts and their corresponding descriptions. We evaluate the model\\nperformance via several case studies due to the time limit, and the promising\\nresults demonstrated that FinVis-GPT is superior in various financial chart\\nrelated tasks, including generating descriptions, answering questions and\\npredicting future market trends, surpassing existing state-of-the-art\\nmultimodal LLMs. The proposed FinVis-GPT serves as a pioneering effort in\\nutilizing multimodal LLMs in the finance domain and our generated dataset will\\nbe release for public use in the near future to speedup related research.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Learning to be Homo Economicus: Can an LLM Learn Preferences from Choice\\nSummary:   This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision aids,\\nwith a focus on their ability to learn preferences and provide personalized\\nrecommendations. To establish a baseline, we replicate standard economic\\nexperiments on choice under risk (Choi et al., 2007) with GPT, one of the most\\nprominent LLMs, prompted to respond as (i) a human decision maker or (ii) a\\nrecommendation system for customers. With these baselines established, GPT is\\nprovided with a sample set of choices and prompted to make recommendations\\nbased on the provided data. From the data generated by GPT, we identify its\\n(revealed) preferences and explore its ability to learn from data. Our analysis\\nyields three results. First, GPT\\'s choices are consistent with (expected)\\nutility maximization theory. Second, GPT can align its recommendations with\\npeople\\'s risk aversion, by recommending less risky portfolios to more\\nrisk-averse decision makers, highlighting GPT\\'s potential as a personalized\\ndecision aid. Third, however, GPT demonstrates limited alignment when it comes\\nto disappointment aversion.\\n\\n\\nTitle: ChatGPT as a commenter to the news: can LLMs generate human-like\\n  opinions?\\nSummary:   ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, and other large language models (LLMs) have drawn\\nsignificant attention since their release, and the abilities of these models\\nhave been investigated for a wide variety of tasks. In this research we\\ninvestigate to what extent GPT-3.5 can generate human-like comments on Dutch\\nnews articles. We define human likeness as `not distinguishable from human\\ncomments\\', approximated by the difficulty of automatic classification between\\nhuman and GPT comments. We analyze human likeness across multiple prompting\\ntechniques. In particular, we utilize zero-shot, few-shot and context prompts,\\nfor two generated personas. We found that our fine-tuned BERT models can easily\\ndistinguish human-written comments from GPT-3.5 generated comments, with none\\nof the used prompting methods performing noticeably better. We further analyzed\\nthat human comments consistently showed higher lexical diversity than\\nGPT-generated comments. This indicates that although generative LLMs can\\ngenerate fluent text, their capability to create human-like opinionated\\ncomments is still limited.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Demonstration of DB-GPT: Next Generation Data Interaction System\\n  Empowered by Large Language Models\\nSummary:   The recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) are positioned to\\ntransition many areas of software. The technologies of interacting with data\\nparticularly have an important entanglement with LLMs as efficient and\\nintuitive data interactions are paramount. In this paper, we present DB-GPT, a\\nrevolutionary and product-ready Python library that integrates LLMs into\\ntraditional data interaction tasks to enhance user experience and\\naccessibility. DB-GPT is designed to understand data interaction tasks\\ndescribed by natural language and provide context-aware responses powered by\\nLLMs, making it an indispensable tool for users ranging from novice to expert.\\nIts system design supports deployment across local, distributed, and cloud\\nenvironments. Beyond handling basic data interaction tasks like Text-to-SQL\\nwith LLMs, it can handle complex tasks like generative data analysis through a\\nMulti-Agents framework and the Agentic Workflow Expression Language (AWEL). The\\nService-oriented Multi-model Management Framework (SMMF) ensures data privacy\\nand security, enabling users to employ DB-GPT with private LLMs. Additionally,\\nDB-GPT offers a series of product-ready features designed to enable users to\\nintegrate DB-GPT within their product environments easily. The code of DB-GPT\\nis available at Github(https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT) which already\\nhas over 10.7k stars. Please install DB-GPT for your own usage with the\\ninstructions(https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT#install) and watch a\\n5-minute introduction video on Youtube(https://youtu.be/n_8RI1ENyl4) to further\\ninvestigate DB-GPT.\\n\\n\\nTitle: A Comprehensive Survey on Evaluating Large Language Model Applications\\n  in the Medical Industry\\nSummary:   Since the inception of the Transformer architecture in 2017, Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT have evolved significantly, impacting\\nvarious industries with their advanced capabilities in language understanding\\nand generation. These models have shown potential to transform the medical\\nfield, highlighting the necessity for specialized evaluation frameworks to\\nensure their effective and ethical deployment. This comprehensive survey\\ndelineates the extensive application and requisite evaluation of LLMs within\\nhealthcare, emphasizing the critical need for empirical validation to fully\\nexploit their capabilities in enhancing healthcare outcomes. Our survey is\\nstructured to provide an in-depth analysis of LLM applications across clinical\\nsettings, medical text data processing, research, education, and public health\\nawareness. We begin by exploring the roles of LLMs in various medical\\napplications, detailing their evaluation based on performance in tasks such as\\nclinical diagnosis, medical text data processing, information retrieval, data\\nanalysis, and educational content generation. The subsequent sections offer a\\ncomprehensive discussion on the evaluation methods and metrics employed,\\nincluding models, evaluators, and comparative experiments. We further examine\\nthe benchmarks and datasets utilized in these evaluations, providing a\\ncategorized description of benchmarks for tasks like question answering,\\nsummarization, information extraction, bioinformatics, information retrieval\\nand general comprehensive benchmarks. This structure ensures a thorough\\nunderstanding of how LLMs are assessed for their effectiveness, accuracy,\\nusability, and ethical alignment in the medical domain. ...\\n\\n\\nTitle: Text Summarization Using Large Language Models: A Comparative Study of\\n  MPT-7b-instruct, Falcon-7b-instruct, and OpenAI Chat-GPT Models\\nSummary:   Text summarization is a critical Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with\\napplications ranging from information retrieval to content generation.\\nLeveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown remarkable promise in\\nenhancing summarization techniques. This paper embarks on an exploration of\\ntext summarization with a diverse set of LLMs, including MPT-7b-instruct,\\nfalcon-7b-instruct, and OpenAI ChatGPT text-davinci-003 models. The experiment\\nwas performed with different hyperparameters and evaluated the generated\\nsummaries using widely accepted metrics such as the Bilingual Evaluation\\nUnderstudy (BLEU) Score, Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation\\n(ROUGE) Score, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\\n(BERT) Score. According to the experiment, text-davinci-003 outperformed the\\nothers. This investigation involved two distinct datasets: CNN Daily Mail and\\nXSum. Its primary objective was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the\\nperformance of Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to different datasets.\\nThe assessment of these models\\' effectiveness contributes valuable insights to\\nresearchers and practitioners within the NLP domain. This work serves as a\\nresource for those interested in harnessing the potential of LLMs for text\\nsummarization and lays the foundation for the development of advanced\\nGenerative AI applications aimed at addressing a wide spectrum of business\\nchallenges.\\n\\n\\nTitle: PARIKSHA : A Large-Scale Investigation of Human-LLM Evaluator Agreement\\n  on Multilingual and Multi-Cultural Data\\nSummary:   Evaluation of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to\\na variety of factors -- the lack of benchmarks with sufficient linguistic\\ndiversity, contamination of popular benchmarks into LLM pre-training data and\\nthe lack of local, cultural nuances in translated benchmarks. In this work, we\\nstudy human and LLM-based evaluation in a multilingual, multi-cultural setting.\\nWe evaluate 30 models across 10 Indic languages by conducting 90K human\\nevaluations and 30K LLM-based evaluations and find that models such as GPT-4o\\nand Llama-3 70B consistently perform best for most Indic languages. We build\\nleaderboards for two evaluation settings - pairwise comparison and direct\\nassessment and analyse the agreement between humans and LLMs. We find that\\nhumans and LLMs agree fairly well in the pairwise setting but the agreement\\ndrops for direct assessment evaluation especially for languages such as Bengali\\nand Odia. We also check for various biases in human and LLM-based evaluation\\nand find evidence of self-bias in the GPT-based evaluator. Our work presents a\\nsignificant step towards scaling up multilingual evaluation of LLMs.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Resource Management for GPT-based Model Deployed on Clouds: Challenges,\\n  Solutions, and Future Directions\\nSummary:   The widespread adoption of the large language model (LLM), e.g. Generative\\nPre-trained Transformer (GPT), deployed on cloud computing environment (e.g.\\nAzure) has led to a huge increased demand for resources. This surge in demand\\nposes significant challenges to resource management in clouds. This paper aims\\nto highlight these challenges by first identifying the unique characteristics\\nof resource management for the GPT-based model. Building upon this\\nunderstanding, we analyze the specific challenges faced by resource management\\nin the context of GPT-based model deployed on clouds, and propose corresponding\\npotential solutions. To facilitate effective resource management, we introduce\\na comprehensive resource management framework and present resource scheduling\\nalgorithms specifically designed for the GPT-based model. Furthermore, we delve\\ninto the future directions for resource management in the GPT-based model,\\nhighlighting potential areas for further exploration and improvement. Through\\nthis study, we aim to provide valuable insights into resource management for\\nGPT-based models deployed in clouds and promote their sustainable development\\nfor GPT-based models and applications.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Opening A Pandora\\'s Box: Things You Should Know in the Era of Custom\\n  GPTs\\nSummary:   The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly accelerated\\nthe development of a wide range of applications across various fields. There is\\na growing trend in the construction of specialized platforms based on LLMs,\\nsuch as the newly introduced custom GPTs by OpenAI. While custom GPTs provide\\nvarious functionalities like web browsing and code execution, they also\\nintroduce significant security threats. In this paper, we conduct a\\ncomprehensive analysis of the security and privacy issues arising from the\\ncustom GPT platform. Our systematic examination categorizes potential attack\\nscenarios into three threat models based on the role of the malicious actor,\\nand identifies critical data exchange channels in custom GPTs. Utilizing the\\nSTRIDE threat modeling framework, we identify 26 potential attack vectors, with\\n19 being partially or fully validated in real-world settings. Our findings\\nemphasize the urgent need for robust security and privacy measures in the\\ncustom GPT ecosystem, especially in light of the forthcoming launch of the\\nofficial GPT store by OpenAI.\\n\\n\\nTitle: The Emergence of Economic Rationality of GPT\\nSummary:   As large language models (LLMs) like GPT become increasingly prevalent, it is\\nessential that we assess their capabilities beyond language processing. This\\npaper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make\\nbudgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences.\\nWe measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT\\'s decisions\\nwith utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that\\nGPT\\'s decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher\\nrationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in\\nthe literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are\\nslightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of\\nheterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the\\ndegree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender, but are\\nsensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations.\\nThese results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need\\nto further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying\\nmechanisms.\\n\\n\\nTitle: From Chatbots to PhishBots? -- Preventing Phishing scams created using\\n  ChatGPT, Google Bard and Claude\\nSummary:   The advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them\\ninvaluable across various applications, from conversational agents and content\\ncreation to data analysis, research, and innovation. However, their\\neffectiveness and accessibility also render them susceptible to abuse for\\ngenerating malicious content, including phishing attacks. This study explores\\nthe potential of using four popular commercially available LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT\\n(GPT 3.5 Turbo), GPT 4, Claude, and Bard, to generate functional phishing\\nattacks using a series of malicious prompts. We discover that these LLMs can\\ngenerate both phishing websites and emails that can convincingly imitate\\nwell-known brands and also deploy a range of evasive tactics that are used to\\nelude detection mechanisms employed by anti-phishing systems. These attacks can\\nbe generated using unmodified or \"vanilla\" versions of these LLMs without\\nrequiring any prior adversarial exploits such as jailbreaking. We evaluate the\\nperformance of the LLMs towards generating these attacks and find that they can\\nalso be utilized to create malicious prompts that, in turn, can be fed back to\\nthe model to generate phishing scams - thus massively reducing the\\nprompt-engineering effort required by attackers to scale these threats. As a\\ncountermeasure, we build a BERT-based automated detection tool that can be used\\nfor the early detection of malicious prompts to prevent LLMs from generating\\nphishing content. Our model is transferable across all four commercial LLMs,\\nattaining an average accuracy of 96% for phishing website prompts and 94% for\\nphishing email prompts. We also disclose the vulnerabilities to the concerned\\nLLMs, with Google acknowledging it as a severe issue. Our detection model is\\navailable for use at Hugging Face, as well as a ChatGPT Actions plugin.\\n\\n\\nTitle: FACT-GPT: Fact-Checking Augmentation via Claim Matching with LLMs\\nSummary:   Our society is facing rampant misinformation harming public health and trust.\\nTo address the societal challenge, we introduce FACT-GPT, a system leveraging\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to automate the claim matching stage of\\nfact-checking. FACT-GPT, trained on a synthetic dataset, identifies social\\nmedia content that aligns with, contradicts, or is irrelevant to previously\\ndebunked claims. Our evaluation shows that our specialized LLMs can match the\\naccuracy of larger models in identifying related claims, closely mirroring\\nhuman judgment. This research provides an automated solution for efficient\\nclaim matching, demonstrates the potential of LLMs in supporting fact-checkers,\\nand offers valuable resources for further research in the field.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Bad Actor, Good Advisor: Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in\\n  Fake News Detection\\nSummary:   Detecting fake news requires both a delicate sense of diverse clues and a\\nprofound understanding of the real-world background, which remains challenging\\nfor detectors based on small language models (SLMs) due to their knowledge and\\ncapability limitations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\\nshown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could\\nhelp with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we\\ninvestigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection. First, we conduct an\\nempirical study and find that a sophisticated LLM such as GPT 3.5 could\\ngenerally expose fake news and provide desirable multi-perspective rationales\\nbut still underperforms the basic SLM, fine-tuned BERT. Our subsequent analysis\\nattributes such a gap to the LLM\\'s inability to select and integrate rationales\\nproperly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may\\nnot substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor\\nfor SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate\\nthis proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news\\ndetection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis\\nfrom the LLMs\\' rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by\\ndistillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without\\nquerying LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and\\nARG-D outperform three types of baseline methods, including SLM-based,\\nLLM-based, and combinations of small and large language models.\\n\\n\\nTitle: HPC-GPT: Integrating Large Language Model for High-Performance Computing\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), including the LLaMA model, have exhibited their\\nefficacy across various general-domain natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\\nHowever, their performance in high-performance computing (HPC) domain tasks has\\nbeen less than optimal due to the specialized expertise required to interpret\\nthe model responses. In response to this challenge, we propose HPC-GPT, a novel\\nLLaMA-based model that has been supervised fine-tuning using generated QA\\n(Question-Answer) instances for the HPC domain. To evaluate its effectiveness,\\nwe concentrate on two HPC tasks: managing AI models and datasets for HPC, and\\ndata race detection. By employing HPC-GPT, we demonstrate comparable\\nperformance with existing methods on both tasks, exemplifying its excellence in\\nHPC-related scenarios. Our experiments on open-source benchmarks yield\\nextensive results, underscoring HPC-GPT\\'s potential to bridge the performance\\ngap between LLMs and HPC-specific tasks. With HPC-GPT, we aim to pave the way\\nfor LLMs to excel in HPC domains, simplifying the utilization of language\\nmodels in complex computing applications.\\n\\n\\nTitle: ChiMed-GPT: A Chinese Medical Large Language Model with Full Training\\n  Regime and Better Alignment to Human Preferences\\nSummary:   Recently, the increasing demand for superior medical services has highlighted\\nthe discrepancies in the medical infrastructure. With big data, especially\\ntexts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for\\neffective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the\\nhealthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models\\npresent promising results in this domain and current large language models\\n(LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most\\nmedical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it\\nefficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but\\nis ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference.\\nAnother engineering barrier that prevents current medical LLM from better text\\nprocessing ability is their restricted context length (e.g., 2,048 tokens),\\nmaking it hard for the LLMs to process long context, which is frequently\\nrequired in the medical domain. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new\\nbenchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, with enlarged\\ncontext length to 4,096 tokens and undergoes a comprehensive training regime\\nwith pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on real-world tasks including\\ninformation extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate\\nChiMed-GPT\\'s superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we\\nanalyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales\\nregarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further\\nresponsible development of LLMs in the medical domain. The code and model are\\nreleased at https://github.com/synlp/ChiMed-GPT.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Adapting GPT, GPT-2 and BERT Language Models for Speech Recognition\\nSummary:   Language models (LMs) pre-trained on massive amounts of text, in particular\\nbidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), generative\\npre-training (GPT), and GPT-2, have become a key technology for many natural\\nlanguage processing tasks. In this paper, we present results using fine-tuned\\nGPT, GPT-2, and their combination for automatic speech recognition (ASR).\\nUnlike unidirectional LM GPT and GPT-2, BERT is bidirectional whose direct\\nproduct of the output probabilities is no longer a valid language prior\\nprobability. A conversion method is proposed to compute the correct language\\nprior probability based on bidirectional LM outputs in a mathematically exact\\nway. Experimental results on the widely used AMI and Switchboard ASR tasks\\nshowed that the combination of the fine-tuned GPT and GPT-2 outperformed the\\ncombination of three neural LMs with different architectures trained from\\nscratch on the in-domain text by up to a 12% relative word error rate reduction\\n(WERR). Furthermore, on the AMI corpus, the proposed conversion for language\\nprior probabilities enables BERT to obtain an extra 3% relative WERR, and the\\ncombination of BERT, GPT and GPT-2 results in further improvements.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPTZoo: A Large-scale Dataset of GPTs for the Research Community\\nSummary:   The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized\\nnatural language processing, with GPTs, customized versions of ChatGPT\\navailable on the GPT Store, emerging as a prominent technology for specific\\ndomains and tasks. To support academic research on GPTs, we introduce GPTZoo, a\\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 730,420 GPT instances. Each instance includes\\nrich metadata with 21 attributes describing its characteristics, as well as\\ninstructions, knowledge files, and third-party services utilized during its\\ndevelopment. GPTZoo aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive and\\nreadily available resource to study the real-world applications, performance,\\nand potential of GPTs. To facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis of GPTs,\\nwe also developed an automated command-line interface (CLI) that supports\\nkeyword-based searching of the dataset. To promote open research and\\ninnovation, the GPTZoo dataset will undergo continuous updates, and we are\\ngranting researchers public access to GPTZoo and its associated tools.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Evaluating Large Language Models on Graphs: Performance Insights and\\n  Comparative Analysis\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest within both\\nacademic and industrial. Yet, the application of LLMs to graph data remains\\nunder-explored. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of four LLMs in\\naddressing several analytical problems with graph data. We employ four distinct\\nevaluation metrics: Comprehension, Correctness, Fidelity, and Rectification.\\nOur results show that: 1) LLMs effectively comprehend graph data in natural\\nlanguage and reason with graph topology. 2) GPT models can generate logical and\\ncoherent results, outperforming alternatives in correctness. 3) All examined\\nLLMs face challenges in structural reasoning, with techniques like zero-shot\\nchain-of-thought and few-shot prompting showing diminished efficacy. 4) GPT\\nmodels often produce erroneous answers in multi-answer tasks, raising concerns\\nin fidelity. 5) GPT models exhibit elevated confidence in their outputs,\\npotentially hindering their rectification capacities. Notably, GPT-4 has\\ndemonstrated the capacity to rectify responses from GPT-3.5-turbo and its own\\nprevious iterations. The code is available at:\\nhttps://github.com/Ayame1006/LLMtoGraph.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Exploring Boundary of GPT-4V on Marine Analysis: A Preliminary Case\\n  Study\\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a powerful ability to answer\\nvarious queries as a general-purpose assistant. The continuous multi-modal\\nlarge language models (MLLM) empower LLMs with the ability to perceive visual\\nsignals. The launch of GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) has\\ngenerated significant interest in the research communities. GPT-4V(ison) has\\ndemonstrated significant power in both academia and industry fields, as a focal\\npoint in a new artificial intelligence generation. Though significant success\\nwas achieved by GPT-4V, exploring MLLMs in domain-specific analysis (e.g.,\\nmarine analysis) that required domain-specific knowledge and expertise has\\ngained less attention. In this study, we carry out the preliminary and\\ncomprehensive case study of utilizing GPT-4V for marine analysis. This report\\nconducts a systematic evaluation of existing GPT-4V, assessing the performance\\nof GPT-4V on marine research and also setting a new standard for future\\ndevelopments in MLLMs. The experimental results of GPT-4V show that the\\nresponses generated by GPT-4V are still far away from satisfying the\\ndomain-specific requirements of the marine professions. All images and prompts\\nused in this study will be available at\\nhttps://github.com/hkust-vgd/Marine_GPT-4V_Eval\\n\\n\\nTitle: Geotechnical Parrot Tales (GPT): Harnessing Large Language Models in\\n  geotechnical engineering\\nSummary:   The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI\\'s\\nChatGPT, could revolutionize various industries, including geotechnical\\nengineering. However, GPT models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but\\nfalse outputs, leading to hallucinations. In this article, we discuss the\\nimportance of prompt engineering in mitigating these risks and harnessing the\\nfull potential of GPT for geotechnical applications. We explore the challenges\\nand pitfalls associated with LLMs and highlight the role of context in ensuring\\naccurate and valuable responses. Furthermore, we examine the development of\\ncontext-specific search engines and the potential of LLMs to become a natural\\ninterface for complex tasks, such as data analysis and design. We also develop\\na unified interface using natural language to handle complex geotechnical\\nengineering tasks and data analysis. By integrating GPT into geotechnical\\nengineering workflows, professionals can streamline their work and develop\\nsustainable and resilient infrastructure systems for the future.\\n\\n\\nTitle: From Model-centered to Human-Centered: Revision Distance as a Metric for\\n  Text Evaluation in LLMs-based Applications\\nSummary:   Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is fundamental, particularly in the\\ncontext of practical applications. Conventional evaluation methods, typically\\ndesigned primarily for LLM development, yield numerical scores that ignore the\\nuser experience. Therefore, our study shifts the focus from model-centered to\\nhuman-centered evaluation in the context of AI-powered writing assistance\\napplications. Our proposed metric, termed ``Revision Distance,\\'\\' utilizes LLMs\\nto suggest revision edits that mimic the human writing process. It is\\ndetermined by counting the revision edits generated by LLMs. Benefiting from\\nthe generated revision edit details, our metric can provide a self-explained\\ntext evaluation result in a human-understandable manner beyond the\\ncontext-independent score. Our results show that for the easy-writing task,\\n``Revision Distance\\'\\' is consistent with established metrics (ROUGE,\\nBert-score, and GPT-score), but offers more insightful, detailed feedback and\\nbetter distinguishes between texts. Moreover, in the context of challenging\\nacademic writing tasks, our metric still delivers reliable evaluations where\\nother metrics tend to struggle. Furthermore, our metric also holds significant\\npotential for scenarios lacking reference texts.\\n\\n\\nTitle: LLM Self Defense: By Self Examination, LLMs Know They Are Being Tricked\\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) are popular for high-quality text generation but\\ncan produce harmful content, even when aligned with human values through\\nreinforcement learning. Adversarial prompts can bypass their safety measures.\\nWe propose LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks\\nby having an LLM screen the induced responses. Our method does not require any\\nfine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we\\nincorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another\\ninstance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. We\\ntest LLM Self Defense on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2, two of the current most prominent\\nLLMs against various types of attacks, such as forcefully inducing affirmative\\nresponses to prompts and prompt engineering attacks. Notably, LLM Self Defense\\nsucceeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 using both GPT 3.5\\nand Llama 2. The code is publicly available at\\nhttps://github.com/poloclub/llm-self-defense\\n\\n\\nTitle: DB-GPT: Empowering Database Interactions with Private Large Language\\n  Models\\nSummary:   The recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) are positioned to\\ntransition many areas of software. Database technologies particularly have an\\nimportant entanglement with LLMs as efficient and intuitive database\\ninteractions are paramount. In this paper, we present DB-GPT, a revolutionary\\nand production-ready project that integrates LLMs with traditional database\\nsystems to enhance user experience and accessibility. DB-GPT is designed to\\nunderstand natural language queries, provide context-aware responses, and\\ngenerate complex SQL queries with high accuracy, making it an indispensable\\ntool for users ranging from novice to expert. The core innovation in DB-GPT\\nlies in its private LLM technology, which is fine-tuned on domain-specific\\ncorpora to maintain user privacy and ensure data security while offering the\\nbenefits of state-of-the-art LLMs. We detail the architecture of DB-GPT, which\\nincludes a novel retrieval augmented generation (RAG) knowledge system, an\\nadaptive learning mechanism to continuously improve performance based on user\\nfeedback and a service-oriented multi-model framework (SMMF) with powerful\\ndata-driven agents. Our extensive experiments and user studies confirm that\\nDB-GPT represents a paradigm shift in database interactions, offering a more\\nnatural, efficient, and secure way to engage with data repositories. The paper\\nconcludes with a discussion of the implications of DB-GPT framework on the\\nfuture of human-database interaction and outlines potential avenues for further\\nenhancements and applications in the field. The project code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT. Experience DB-GPT for yourself by\\ninstalling it with the instructions\\nhttps://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT#install and view a concise 10-minute\\nvideo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYs4nTDzEhk.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Are Large Language Models Good Statisticians?\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across\\na range of scientific tasks including mathematics, physics, and chemistry.\\nDespite their successes, the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex\\nstatistical tasks remains systematically under-explored. To bridge this gap, we\\nintroduce StatQA, a new benchmark designed for statistical analysis tasks.\\nStatQA comprises 11,623 examples tailored to evaluate LLMs\\' proficiency in\\nspecialized statistical tasks and their applicability assessment capabilities,\\nparticularly for hypothesis testing methods. We systematically experiment with\\nrepresentative LLMs using various prompting strategies and show that even\\nstate-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve a best performance of only\\n64.83%, indicating significant room for improvement. Notably, while open-source\\nLLMs (e.g. LLaMA-3) show limited capability, those fine-tuned ones exhibit\\nmarked improvements, outperforming all in-context learning-based methods (e.g.\\nGPT-4o). Moreover, our comparative human experiments highlight a striking\\ncontrast in error types between LLMs and humans: LLMs primarily make\\napplicability errors, whereas humans mostly make statistical task confusion\\nerrors. This divergence highlights distinct areas of proficiency and\\ndeficiency, suggesting that combining LLM and human expertise could lead to\\ncomplementary strengths, inviting further investigation into their\\ncollaborative potential.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Instruction Backdoor Attacks Against Customized LLMs\\nSummary:   The increasing demand for customized Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to\\nthe development of solutions like GPTs. These solutions facilitate tailored LLM\\ncreation via natural language prompts without coding. However, the\\ntrustworthiness of third-party custom versions of LLMs remains an essential\\nconcern. In this paper, we propose the first instruction backdoor attacks\\nagainst applications integrated with untrusted customized LLMs (e.g., GPTs).\\nSpecifically, these attacks embed the backdoor into the custom version of LLMs\\nby designing prompts with backdoor instructions, outputting the attacker\\'s\\ndesired result when inputs contain the pre-defined triggers. Our attack\\nincludes 3 levels of attacks: word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level,\\nwhich adopt different types of triggers with progressive stealthiness. We\\nstress that our attacks do not require fine-tuning or any modification to the\\nbackend LLMs, adhering strictly to GPTs development guidelines. We conduct\\nextensive experiments on 6 prominent LLMs and 5 benchmark text classification\\ndatasets. The results show that our instruction backdoor attacks achieve the\\ndesired attack performance without compromising utility. Additionally, we\\npropose two defense strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing\\nsuch attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerability and the potential risks\\nof LLM customization such as GPTs.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Pandora: Jailbreak GPTs by Retrieval Augmented Generation Poisoning\\nSummary:   Large Language Models~(LLMs) have gained immense popularity and are being\\nincreasingly applied in various domains. Consequently, ensuring the security of\\nthese models is of paramount importance. Jailbreak attacks, which manipulate\\nLLMs to generate malicious content, are recognized as a significant\\nvulnerability. While existing research has predominantly focused on direct\\njailbreak attacks on LLMs, there has been limited exploration of indirect\\nmethods. The integration of various plugins into LLMs, notably Retrieval\\nAugmented Generation~(RAG), which enables LLMs to incorporate external\\nknowledge bases into their response generation such as GPTs, introduces new\\navenues for indirect jailbreak attacks.\\n  To fill this gap, we investigate indirect jailbreak attacks on LLMs,\\nparticularly GPTs, introducing a novel attack vector named Retrieval Augmented\\nGeneration Poisoning. This method, Pandora, exploits the synergy between LLMs\\nand RAG through prompt manipulation to generate unexpected responses. Pandora\\nuses maliciously crafted content to influence the RAG process, effectively\\ninitiating jailbreak attacks. Our preliminary tests show that Pandora\\nsuccessfully conducts jailbreak attacks in four different scenarios, achieving\\nhigher success rates than direct attacks, with 64.3\\\\% for GPT-3.5 and 34.8\\\\%\\nfor GPT-4.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Harnessing Large Language Models Over Transformer Models for Detecting\\n  Bengali Depressive Social Media Text: A Comprehensive Study\\nSummary:   In an era where the silent struggle of underdiagnosed depression pervades\\nglobally, our research delves into the crucial link between mental health and\\nsocial media. This work focuses on early detection of depression, particularly\\nin extroverted social media users, using LLMs such as GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and our\\nproposed GPT 3.5 fine-tuned model DepGPT, as well as advanced Deep learning\\nmodels(LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, BiGRU) and Transformer models(BERT, BanglaBERT,\\nSahajBERT, BanglaBERT-Base). The study categorized Reddit and X datasets into\\n\"Depressive\" and \"Non-Depressive\" segments, translated into Bengali by native\\nspeakers with expertise in mental health, resulting in the creation of the\\nBengali Social Media Depressive Dataset (BSMDD). Our work provides full\\narchitecture details for each model and a methodical way to assess their\\nperformance in Bengali depressive text categorization using zero-shot and\\nfew-shot learning techniques. Our work demonstrates the superiority of\\nSahajBERT and Bi-LSTM with FastText embeddings in their respective domains also\\ntackles explainability issues with transformer models and emphasizes the\\neffectiveness of LLMs, especially DepGPT, demonstrating flexibility and\\ncompetence in a range of learning contexts. According to the experiment\\nresults, the proposed model, DepGPT, outperformed not only Alpaca Lora 7B in\\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios but also every other model, achieving a\\nnear-perfect accuracy of 0.9796 and an F1-score of 0.9804, high recall, and\\nexceptional precision. Although competitive, GPT-3.5 Turbo and Alpaca Lora 7B\\nshow relatively poorer effectiveness in zero-shot and few-shot situations. The\\nwork emphasizes the effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs in a variety of\\nlinguistic circumstances, providing insightful information about the complex\\nfield of depression detection models.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPT-who: An Information Density-based Machine-Generated Text Detector\\nSummary:   The Uniform Information Density (UID) principle posits that humans prefer to\\nspread information evenly during language production. We examine if this UID\\nprinciple can help capture differences between Large Language Models\\n(LLMs)-generated and human-generated texts. We propose GPT-who, the first\\npsycholinguistically-inspired domain-agnostic statistical detector. This\\ndetector employs UID-based features to model the unique statistical signature\\nof each LLM and human author for accurate detection. We evaluate our method\\nusing 4 large-scale benchmark datasets and find that GPT-who outperforms\\nstate-of-the-art detectors (both statistical- & non-statistical) such as GLTR,\\nGPTZero, DetectGPT, OpenAI detector, and ZeroGPT by over $20$% across domains.\\nIn addition to better performance, it is computationally inexpensive and\\nutilizes an interpretable representation of text articles. We find that GPT-who\\ncan distinguish texts generated by very sophisticated LLMs, even when the\\noverlying text is indiscernible. UID-based measures for all datasets and code\\nare available at https://github.com/saranya-venkatraman/gpt-who.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Can GPT models Follow Human Summarization Guidelines? Evaluating ChatGPT\\n  and GPT-4 for Dialogue Summarization\\nSummary:   This study explores the capabilities of prompt-driven Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in adhering to human guidelines for dialogue\\nsummarization. Experiments employed DialogSum (English social conversations)\\nand DECODA (French call center interactions), testing various prompts:\\nincluding prompts from existing literature and those from human summarization\\nguidelines, as well as a two-step prompt approach. Our findings indicate that\\nGPT models often produce lengthy summaries and deviate from human summarization\\nguidelines. However, using human guidelines as an intermediate step shows\\npromise, outperforming direct word-length constraint prompts in some cases. The\\nresults reveal that GPT models exhibit unique stylistic tendencies in their\\nsummaries. While BERTScores did not dramatically decrease for GPT outputs\\nsuggesting semantic similarity to human references and specialised pre-trained\\nmodels, ROUGE scores reveal grammatical and lexical disparities between\\nGPT-generated and human-written summaries. These findings shed light on the\\ncapabilities and limitations of GPT models in following human instructions for\\ndialogue summarization.\\n\\n\\nTitle: KG-GPT: A General Framework for Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs Using\\n  Large Language Models\\nSummary:   While large language models (LLMs) have made considerable advancements in\\nunderstanding and generating unstructured text, their application in structured\\ndata remains underexplored. Particularly, using LLMs for complex reasoning\\ntasks on knowledge graphs (KGs) remains largely untouched. To address this, we\\npropose KG-GPT, a multi-purpose framework leveraging LLMs for tasks employing\\nKGs. KG-GPT comprises three steps: Sentence Segmentation, Graph Retrieval, and\\nInference, each aimed at partitioning sentences, retrieving relevant graph\\ncomponents, and deriving logical conclusions, respectively. We evaluate KG-GPT\\nusing KG-based fact verification and KGQA benchmarks, with the model showing\\ncompetitive and robust performance, even outperforming several fully-supervised\\nmodels. Our work, therefore, marks a significant step in unifying structured\\nand unstructured data processing within the realm of LLMs.\\n\\n\\nTitle: SurgicalGPT: End-to-End Language-Vision GPT for Visual Question\\n  Answering in Surgery\\nSummary:   Advances in GPT-based large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing\\nnatural language processing, exponentially increasing its use across various\\ndomains. Incorporating uni-directional attention, these autoregressive LLMs can\\ngenerate long and coherent paragraphs. However, for visual question answering\\n(VQA) tasks that require both vision and language processing, models with\\nbi-directional attention or models employing fusion techniques are often\\nemployed to capture the context of multiple modalities all at once. As GPT does\\nnot natively process vision tokens, to exploit the advancements in GPT models\\nfor VQA in robotic surgery, we design an end-to-end trainable Language-Vision\\nGPT (LV-GPT) model that expands the GPT2 model to include vision input (image).\\nThe proposed LV-GPT incorporates a feature extractor (vision tokenizer) and\\nvision token embedding (token type and pose). Given the limitations of\\nunidirectional attention in GPT models and their ability to generate coherent\\nlong paragraphs, we carefully sequence the word tokens before vision tokens,\\nmimicking the human thought process of understanding the question to infer an\\nanswer from an image. Quantitatively, we prove that the LV-GPT model\\noutperforms other state-of-the-art VQA models on two publically available\\nsurgical-VQA datasets (based on endoscopic vision challenge robotic scene\\nsegmentation 2018 and CholecTriplet2021) and on our newly annotated dataset\\n(based on the holistic surgical scene dataset). We further annotate all three\\ndatasets to include question-type annotations to allow sub-type analysis.\\nFurthermore, we extensively study and present the effects of token sequencing,\\ntoken type and pose embedding for vision tokens in the LV-GPT model.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Evaluating Text Summaries Generated by Large Language Models Using\\n  OpenAI\\'s GPT\\nSummary:   This research examines the effectiveness of OpenAI\\'s GPT models as\\nindependent evaluators of text summaries generated by six transformer-based\\nmodels from Hugging Face: DistilBART, BERT, ProphetNet, T5, BART, and PEGASUS.\\nWe evaluated these summaries based on essential properties of high-quality\\nsummary - conciseness, relevance, coherence, and readability - using\\ntraditional metrics such as ROUGE and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Uniquely,\\nwe also employed GPT not as a summarizer but as an evaluator, allowing it to\\nindependently assess summary quality without predefined metrics. Our analysis\\nrevealed significant correlations between GPT evaluations and traditional\\nmetrics, particularly in assessing relevance and coherence. The results\\ndemonstrate GPT\\'s potential as a robust tool for evaluating text summaries,\\noffering insights that complement established metrics and providing a basis for\\ncomparative analysis of transformer-based models in natural language processing\\ntasks.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Can Large Language Models Understand Molecules?\\nSummary:   Purpose: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained\\nTransformer) from OpenAI and LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Meta AI\\nare increasingly recognized for their potential in the field of\\ncheminformatics, particularly in understanding Simplified Molecular Input Line\\nEntry System (SMILES), a standard method for representing chemical structures.\\nThese LLMs also have the ability to decode SMILES strings into vector\\nrepresentations.\\n  Method: We investigate the performance of GPT and LLaMA compared to\\npre-trained models on SMILES in embedding SMILES strings on downstream tasks,\\nfocusing on two key applications: molecular property prediction and drug-drug\\ninteraction prediction.\\n  Results: We find that SMILES embeddings generated using LLaMA outperform\\nthose from GPT in both molecular property and DDI prediction tasks. Notably,\\nLLaMA-based SMILES embeddings show results comparable to pre-trained models on\\nSMILES in molecular prediction tasks and outperform the pre-trained models for\\nthe DDI prediction tasks.\\n  Conclusion: The performance of LLMs in generating SMILES embeddings shows\\ngreat potential for further investigation of these models for molecular\\nembedding. We hope our study bridges the gap between LLMs and molecular\\nembedding, motivating additional research into the potential of LLMs in the\\nmolecular representation field.

Evaluating GPT on Biomedical\\n  Machine Reading Comprehension\\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks\\nin different domains. However, their performance in closed-book biomedical\\nmachine reading comprehension (MRC) has not been evaluated in depth. In this\\nwork, we evaluate GPT on four closed-book biomedical MRC benchmarks. We\\nexperiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as\\nintroduce our own novel prompting method. To solve some of the retrieval\\nproblems inherent to LLMs, we propose a prompting strategy named Implicit\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that alleviates the need for using vector\\ndatabases to retrieve important chunks in traditional RAG setups. Moreover, we\\nreport qualitative assessments on the natural language generation outputs from\\nour approach. The results show that our new prompting technique is able to get\\nthe best performance in two out of four datasets and ranks second in rest of\\nthem. Experiments show that modern-day LLMs like GPT even in a zero-shot\\nsetting can outperform supervised models, leading to new state-of-the-art\\n(SoTA) results on two of the benchmarks.\\n\\n\\nTitle: AE-GPT: Using Large Language Models to Extract Adverse Events from\\n  Surveillance Reports-A Use Case with Influenza Vaccine Adverse Events\\nSummary:   Though Vaccines are instrumental in global health, mitigating infectious\\ndiseases and pandemic outbreaks, they can occasionally lead to adverse events\\n(AEs). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in effectively\\nidentifying and cataloging AEs within clinical reports. Utilizing data from the\\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 1990 to 2016, this study\\nparticularly focuses on AEs to evaluate LLMs\\' capability for AE extraction. A\\nvariety of prevalent LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3 variants, GPT-4, and Llama 2,\\nwere evaluated using Influenza vaccine as a use case. The fine-tuned GPT 3.5\\nmodel (AE-GPT) stood out with a 0.704 averaged micro F1 score for strict match\\nand 0.816 for relaxed match. The encouraging performance of the AE-GPT\\nunderscores LLMs\\' potential in processing medical data, indicating a\\nsignificant stride towards advanced AE detection, thus presumably generalizable\\nto other AE extraction tasks.\\n\\n\\nTitle: KI-BERT: Infusing Knowledge Context for Better Language and Domain\\n  Understanding\\nSummary:   Contextualized entity representations learned by state-of-the-art\\ntransformer-based language models (TLMs) like BERT, GPT, T5, etc., leverage the\\nattention mechanism to learn the data context from training data corpus.\\nHowever, these models do not use the knowledge context. Knowledge context can\\nbe understood as semantics about entities and their relationship with\\nneighboring entities in knowledge graphs. We propose a novel and effective\\ntechnique to infuse knowledge context from multiple knowledge graphs for\\nconceptual and ambiguous entities into TLMs during fine-tuning. It projects\\nknowledge graph embeddings in the homogeneous vector-space, introduces new\\ntoken-types for entities, aligns entity position ids, and a selective attention\\nmechanism. We take BERT as a baseline model and implement the\\n\"Knowledge-Infused BERT\" by infusing knowledge context from ConceptNet and\\nWordNet, which significantly outperforms BERT and other recent knowledge-aware\\nBERT variants like ERNIE, SenseBERT, and BERT_CS over eight different subtasks\\nof GLUE benchmark. The KI-BERT-base model even significantly outperforms\\nBERT-large for domain-specific tasks like SciTail and academic subsets of QQP,\\nQNLI, and MNLI.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Fairness of ChatGPT and the Role Of Explainable-Guided Prompts\\nSummary:   Our research investigates the potential of Large-scale Language Models\\n(LLMs), specifically OpenAI\\'s GPT, in credit risk assessment-a binary\\nclassification task. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when directed by\\njudiciously designed prompts and supplemented with domain-specific knowledge,\\ncan parallel the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models.\\nIntriguingly, they achieve this with significantly less data-40 times less,\\nutilizing merely 20 data points compared to the ML\\'s 800. LLMs particularly\\nexcel in minimizing false positives and enhancing fairness, both being vital\\naspects of risk analysis. While our results did not surpass those of classical\\nML models, they underscore the potential of LLMs in analogous tasks, laying a\\ngroundwork for future explorations into harnessing the capabilities of LLMs in\\ndiverse ML tasks.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Can Many-Shot In-Context Learning Help Long-Context LLM Judges? See\\n  More, Judge Better!\\nSummary:   Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for evaluating the\\nperformance of LLMs has recently garnered attention. Nonetheless, this type of\\napproach concurrently introduces potential biases from LLMs, raising concerns\\nabout the reliability of the evaluation results. To mitigate this issue, we\\npropose and study two versions of many-shot in-context prompts, Reinforced and\\nUnsupervised ICL, for helping GPT-4o-as-a-Judge in single answer grading. The\\nformer uses in-context examples with model-generated rationales, and the latter\\nwithout. Based on the designed prompts, we investigate the impact of scaling\\nthe number of in-context examples on the agreement and quality of the\\nevaluation. Furthermore, we first reveal the symbol bias in GPT-4o-as-a-Judge\\nfor pairwise comparison and then propose a simple yet effective approach to\\nmitigate it. Experimental results show that advanced long-context LLMs, such as\\nGPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot regime.\\nMeanwhile, the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of the\\nsymbol bias mitigation approach.\\n\\n\\nTitle: DroidBot-GPT: GPT-powered UI Automation for Android\\nSummary:   This paper introduces DroidBot-GPT, a tool that utilizes GPT-like large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) to automate the interactions with Android mobile\\napplications. Given a natural language description of a desired task,\\nDroidBot-GPT can automatically generate and execute actions that navigate the\\napp to complete the task. It works by translating the app GUI state information\\nand the available actions on the smartphone screen to natural language prompts\\nand asking the LLM to make a choice of actions. Since the LLM is typically\\ntrained on a large amount of data including the how-to manuals of diverse\\nsoftware applications, it has the ability to make reasonable choices of actions\\nbased on the provided information. We evaluate DroidBot-GPT with a self-created\\ndataset that contains 33 tasks collected from 17 Android applications spanning\\n10 categories. It can successfully complete 39.39% of the tasks, and the\\naverage partial completion progress is about 66.76%. Given the fact that our\\nmethod is fully unsupervised (no modification required from both the app and\\nthe LLM), we believe there is great potential to enhance automation performance\\nwith better app development paradigms and/or custom model training.\\n\\n\\nTitle: CheX-GPT: Harnessing Large Language Models for Enhanced Chest X-ray\\n  Report Labeling\\nSummary:   Free-text radiology reports present a rich data source for various medical\\ntasks, but effectively labeling these texts remains challenging. Traditional\\nrule-based labeling methods fall short of capturing the nuances of diverse\\nfree-text patterns. Moreover, models using expert-annotated data are limited by\\ndata scarcity and pre-defined classes, impacting their performance, flexibility\\nand scalability. To address these issues, our study offers three main\\ncontributions: 1) We demonstrate the potential of GPT as an adept labeler using\\ncarefully designed prompts. 2) Utilizing only the data labeled by GPT, we\\ntrained a BERT-based labeler, CheX-GPT, which operates faster and more\\nefficiently than its GPT counterpart. 3) To benchmark labeler performance, we\\nintroduced a publicly available expert-annotated test set, MIMIC-500,\\ncomprising 500 cases from the MIMIC validation set. Our findings demonstrate\\nthat CheX-GPT not only excels in labeling accuracy over existing models, but\\nalso showcases superior efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, supported by\\nour introduction of the MIMIC-500 dataset for robust benchmarking. Code and\\nmodels are available at https://github.com/kakaobrain/CheXGPT.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Large Language Models: A Survey\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their\\nstrong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, since the release\\nof ChatGPT in November 2022. LLMs\\' ability of general-purpose language\\nunderstanding and generation is acquired by training billions of model\\'s\\nparameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws\\n\\\\cite{kaplan2020scaling,hoffmann2022training}. The research area of LLMs, while\\nvery recent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper, we\\nreview some of the most prominent LLMs, including three popular LLM families\\n(GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their characteristics, contributions and\\nlimitations. We also give an overview of techniques developed to build, and\\naugment LLMs. We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training,\\nfine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation metrics, and\\ncompare the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative\\nbenchmarks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing open challenges and\\nfuture research directions.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Predictive Minds: LLMs As Atypical Active Inference Agents\\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) like GPT are often conceptualized as passive\\npredictors, simulators, or even stochastic parrots. We instead conceptualize\\nLLMs by drawing on the theory of active inference originating in cognitive\\nscience and neuroscience. We examine similarities and differences between\\ntraditional active inference systems and LLMs, leading to the conclusion that,\\ncurrently, LLMs lack a tight feedback loop between acting in the world and\\nperceiving the impacts of their actions, but otherwise fit in the active\\ninference paradigm. We list reasons why this loop may soon be closed, and\\npossible consequences of this including enhanced model self-awareness and the\\ndrive to minimize prediction error by changing the world.\\n\\n\\nTitle: (Chat)GPT v BERT: Dawn of Justice for Semantic Change Detection\\nSummary:   In the universe of Natural Language Processing, Transformer-based language\\nmodels like BERT and (Chat)GPT have emerged as lexical superheroes with great\\npower to solve open research problems. In this paper, we specifically focus on\\nthe temporal problem of semantic change, and evaluate their ability to solve\\ntwo diachronic extensions of the Word-in-Context (WiC) task: TempoWiC and\\nHistoWiC. In particular, we investigate the potential of a novel, off-the-shelf\\ntechnology like ChatGPT (and GPT) 3.5 compared to BERT, which represents a\\nfamily of models that currently stand as the state-of-the-art for modeling\\nsemantic change. Our experiments represent the first attempt to assess the use\\nof (Chat)GPT for studying semantic change. Our results indicate that ChatGPT\\nperforms significantly worse than the foundational GPT version. Furthermore,\\nour results demonstrate that (Chat)GPT achieves slightly lower performance than\\nBERT in detecting long-term changes but performs significantly worse in\\ndetecting short-term changes.\\n\\n\\nTitle: AutoML-GPT: Automatic Machine Learning with GPT\\nSummary:   AI tasks encompass a wide range of domains and fields. While numerous AI\\nmodels have been designed for specific tasks and applications, they often\\nrequire considerable human efforts in finding the right model architecture,\\noptimization algorithm, and hyperparameters. Recent advances in large language\\nmodels (LLMs) like ChatGPT show remarkable capabilities in various aspects of\\nreasoning, comprehension, and interaction. Consequently, we propose developing\\ntask-oriented prompts and automatically utilizing LLMs to automate the training\\npipeline. To implement this concept, we present the AutoML-GPT, which employs\\nGPT as the bridge to diverse AI models and dynamically trains models with\\noptimized hyperparameters. AutoML-GPT dynamically takes user requests from the\\nmodel and data cards and composes the corresponding prompt paragraph.\\nUltimately, with this prompt paragraph, AutoML-GPT will automatically conduct\\nthe experiments from data processing to model architecture, hyperparameter\\ntuning, and predicted training log. By leveraging {\\\\ours}\\'s robust language\\ncapabilities and the available AI models, AutoML-GPT can tackle numerous\\nintricate AI tasks across various tasks and datasets. This approach achieves\\nremarkable results in computer vision, natural language processing, and other\\nchallenging areas. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that\\nour method can be general, effective, and beneficial for many AI tasks.\\n\\n\\nTitle: CMed-GPT: Prompt Tuning for Entity-Aware Chinese Medical Dialogue\\n  Generation\\nSummary:   Medical dialogue generation relies on natural language generation techniques\\nto enable online medical consultations. Recently, the widespread adoption of\\nlarge-scale models in the field of natural language processing has facilitated\\nrapid advancements in this technology. Existing medical dialogue models are\\nmostly based on BERT and pre-trained on English corpora, but there is a lack of\\nhigh-performing models on the task of Chinese medical dialogue generation. To\\nsolve the above problem, this paper proposes CMed-GPT, which is the GPT\\npre-training language model based on Chinese medical domain text. The model is\\navailable in two versions, namely, base and large, with corresponding\\nperplexity values of 8.64 and 8.01. Additionally, we incorporate lexical and\\nentity embeddings into the dialogue text in a uniform manner to meet the\\nrequirements of downstream dialogue generation tasks. By applying both\\nfine-tuning and p-tuning to CMed-GPT, we lowered the PPL from 8.44 to 7.35.\\nThis study not only confirms the exceptional performance of the CMed-GPT model\\nin generating Chinese biomedical text but also highlights the advantages of\\np-tuning over traditional fine-tuning with prefix prompts. Furthermore, we\\nvalidate the significance of incorporating external information in medical\\ndialogue generation, which enhances the quality of dialogue generation.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Simpler becomes Harder: Do LLMs Exhibit a Coherent Behavior on\\n  Simplified Corpora?\\nSummary:   Text simplification seeks to improve readability while retaining the original\\ncontent and meaning. Our study investigates whether pre-trained classifiers\\nalso maintain such coherence by comparing their predictions on both original\\nand simplified inputs. We conduct experiments using 11 pre-trained models,\\nincluding BERT and OpenAI\\'s GPT 3.5, across six datasets spanning three\\nlanguages. Additionally, we conduct a detailed analysis of the correlation\\nbetween prediction change rates and simplification types/strengths. Our\\nfindings reveal alarming inconsistencies across all languages and models. If\\nnot promptly addressed, simplified inputs can be easily exploited to craft\\nzero-iteration model-agnostic adversarial attacks with success rates of up to\\n50%\\n\\n\\nTitle: Rank-without-GPT: Building GPT-Independent Listwise Rerankers on\\n  Open-Source Large Language Models\\nSummary:   Listwise rerankers based on large language models (LLM) are the zero-shot\\nstate-of-the-art. However, current works in this direction all depend on the\\nGPT models, making it a single point of failure in scientific reproducibility.\\nMoreover, it raises the concern that the current research findings only hold\\nfor GPT models but not LLM in general. In this work, we lift this pre-condition\\nand build for the first time effective listwise rerankers without any form of\\ndependency on GPT. Our passage retrieval experiments show that our best list se\\nreranker surpasses the listwise rerankers based on GPT-3.5 by 13% and achieves\\n97% effectiveness of the ones built on GPT-4. Our results also show that the\\nexisting training datasets, which were expressly constructed for pointwise\\nranking, are insufficient for building such listwise rerankers. Instead,\\nhigh-quality listwise ranking data is required and crucial, calling for further\\nwork on building human-annotated listwise data resources.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Red AI? Inconsistent Responses from GPT3.5 Models on Political Issues in\\n  the US and China\\nSummary:   The rising popularity of ChatGPT and other AI-powered large language models\\n(LLMs) has led to increasing studies highlighting their susceptibility to\\nmistakes and biases. However, most of these studies focus on models trained on\\nEnglish texts. Taking an innovative approach, this study investigates political\\nbiases in GPT\\'s multilingual models. We posed the same question about\\nhigh-profile political issues in the United States and China to GPT in both\\nEnglish and simplified Chinese, and our analysis of the bilingual responses\\nrevealed that GPT\\'s bilingual models\\' political \"knowledge\" (content) and the\\npolitical \"attitude\" (sentiment) are significantly more inconsistent on\\npolitical issues in China. The simplified Chinese GPT models not only tended to\\nprovide pro-China information but also presented the least negative sentiment\\ntowards China\\'s problems, whereas the English GPT was significantly more\\nnegative towards China. This disparity may stem from Chinese state censorship\\nand US-China geopolitical tensions, which influence the training corpora of GPT\\nbilingual models. Moreover, both Chinese and English models tended to be less\\ncritical towards the issues of \"their own\" represented by the language used,\\nthan the issues of \"the other.\" This suggests that GPT multilingual models\\ncould potentially develop a \"political identity\" and an associated sentiment\\nbias based on their training language. We discussed the implications of our\\nfindings for information transmission and communication in an increasingly\\ndivided world.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Can ChatGPT Replace Traditional KBQA Models? An In-depth Analysis of the\\n  Question Answering Performance of the GPT LLM Family\\nSummary:   ChatGPT is a powerful large language model (LLM) that covers knowledge\\nresources such as Wikipedia and supports natural language question answering\\nusing its own knowledge. Therefore, there is growing interest in exploring\\nwhether ChatGPT can replace traditional knowledge-based question answering\\n(KBQA) models. Although there have been some works analyzing the question\\nanswering performance of ChatGPT, there is still a lack of large-scale,\\ncomprehensive testing of various types of complex questions to analyze the\\nlimitations of the model. In this paper, we present a framework that follows\\nthe black-box testing specifications of CheckList proposed by Ribeiro et. al.\\nWe evaluate ChatGPT and its family of LLMs on eight real-world KB-based complex\\nquestion answering datasets, which include six English datasets and two\\nmultilingual datasets. The total number of test cases is approximately 190,000.\\nIn addition to the GPT family of LLMs, we also evaluate the well-known FLAN-T5\\nto identify commonalities between the GPT family and other LLMs. The dataset\\nand code are available at\\nhttps://github.com/tan92hl/Complex-Question-Answering-Evaluation-of-GPT-family.git\\n\\n\\nTitle: Don\\'t Trust ChatGPT when Your Question is not in English: A Study of\\n  Multilingual Abilities and Types of LLMs\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional natural language\\nunderstanding abilities and have excelled in a variety of natural language\\nprocessing (NLP)tasks in recent years. Despite the fact that most LLMs are\\ntrained predominantly in English, multiple studies have demonstrated their\\ncomparative performance in many other languages. However, fundamental questions\\npersist regarding how LLMs acquire their multi-lingual abilities and how\\nperformance varies across different languages. These inquiries are crucial for\\nthe study of LLMs since users and researchers often come from diverse language\\nbackgrounds, potentially influencing their utilization and interpretation of\\nLLMs\\' results. In this work, we propose a systematic way of qualifying the\\nperformance disparities of LLMs under multilingual settings. We investigate the\\nphenomenon of across-language generalizations in LLMs, wherein insufficient\\nmulti-lingual training data leads to advanced multi-lingual capabilities. To\\naccomplish this, we employ a novel back-translation-based prompting method. The\\nresults show that GPT exhibits highly translating-like behaviour in\\nmultilingual settings.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Revolutionizing Mobile Interaction: Enabling a 3 Billion Parameter GPT\\n  LLM on Mobile\\nSummary:   The field of Artificial Intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in\\nrecent years, especially with the emergence of powerful large language models\\n(LLMs) based on the transformer architecture. Cloud-based LLMs, such as\\nOpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, offer impressive capabilities but come with concerns\\nregarding latency and privacy due to network dependencies. This article\\npresents an innovative approach to LLM inference, envisioning a future where\\nLLMs with billions of parameters can be executed directly on mobile devices\\nwithout network connectivity. The article showcases a fine-tuned GPT LLM with 3\\nbillion parameters that can operate smoothly on devices with as low as 4GB of\\nmemory. Through the integration of native code and model quantization\\ntechniques, the application not only serves as a general-purpose assistant but\\nalso facilitates seamless mobile interactions with text-to-actions features.\\nThe article provides insights into the training pipeline, implementation\\ndetails, test results, and future directions of on-device LLM inference. This\\nbreakthrough technology opens up possibilities for empowering users with\\nsophisticated AI capabilities while preserving their privacy and eliminating\\nlatency concerns.\\n\\n\\nTitle: The GitHub Recent Bugs Dataset for Evaluating LLM-based Debugging\\n  Applications\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong natural language\\nprocessing and code synthesis capabilities, which has led to their rapid\\nadoption in software engineering applications. However, details about LLM\\ntraining data are often not made public, which has caused concern as to whether\\nexisting bug benchmarks are included. In lieu of the training data for the\\npopular GPT models, we examine the training data of the open-source LLM\\nStarCoder, and find it likely that data from the widely used Defects4J\\nbenchmark was included, raising the possibility of its inclusion in GPT\\ntraining data as well. This makes it difficult to tell how well LLM-based\\nresults on Defects4J would generalize, as for any results it would be unclear\\nwhether a technique\\'s performance is due to LLM generalization or memorization.\\nTo remedy this issue and facilitate continued research on LLM-based SE, we\\npresent the GitHub Recent Bugs (GHRB) dataset, which includes 76 real-world\\nJava bugs that were gathered after the OpenAI data cut-off point.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Analyzing Narrative Processing in Large Language Models (LLMs): Using\\n  GPT4 to test BERT\\nSummary:   The ability to transmit and receive complex information via language is\\nunique to humans and is the basis of traditions, culture and versatile social\\ninteractions. Through the disruptive introduction of transformer based large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) humans are not the only entity to \"understand\" and\\nproduce language any more. In the present study, we have performed the first\\nsteps to use LLMs as a model to understand fundamental mechanisms of language\\nprocessing in neural networks, in order to make predictions and generate\\nhypotheses on how the human brain does language processing. Thus, we have used\\nChatGPT to generate seven different stylistic variations of ten different\\nnarratives (Aesop\\'s fables). We used these stories as input for the open source\\nLLM BERT and have analyzed the activation patterns of the hidden units of BERT\\nusing multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis. We found that the\\nactivation vectors of the hidden units cluster according to stylistic\\nvariations in earlier layers of BERT (1) than narrative content (4-5). Despite\\nthe fact that BERT consists of 12 identical building blocks that are stacked\\nand trained on large text corpora, the different layers perform different\\ntasks. This is a very useful model of the human brain, where self-similar\\nstructures, i.e. different areas of the cerebral cortex, can have different\\nfunctions and are therefore well suited to processing language in a very\\nefficient way. The proposed approach has the potential to open the black box of\\nLLMs on the one hand, and might be a further step to unravel the neural\\nprocesses underlying human language processing and cognition in general.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of\\n  Large Language Models\\nSummary:   We investigate the potential implications of large language models (LLMs),\\nsuch as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market,\\nfocusing on the increased capabilities arising from LLM-powered software\\ncompared to LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based\\non their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and\\nGPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S.\\nworkforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the\\nintroduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50%\\nof their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or\\nadoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels,\\nwith higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities\\nand LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to\\nindustries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that,\\nwith access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be\\ncompleted significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating\\nsoftware and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47\\nand 56% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have\\na substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models.\\nWe conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose\\ntechnologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social,\\nand policy implications.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPT-in-the-Loop: Adaptive Decision-Making for Multiagent Systems\\nSummary:   This paper introduces the \"GPT-in-the-loop\" approach, a novel method\\ncombining the advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nlike Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) with multiagent (MAS) systems.\\nVenturing beyond traditional adaptive approaches that generally require long\\ntraining processes, our framework employs GPT-4 for enhanced problem-solving\\nand explanation skills. Our experimental backdrop is the smart streetlight\\nInternet of Things (IoT) application. Here, agents use sensors, actuators, and\\nneural networks to create an energy-efficient lighting system. By integrating\\nGPT-4, these agents achieve superior decision-making and adaptability without\\nthe need for extensive training. We compare this approach with both traditional\\nneuroevolutionary methods and solutions provided by software engineers,\\nunderlining the potential of GPT-driven multiagent systems in IoT.\\nStructurally, the paper outlines the incorporation of GPT into the agent-driven\\nFramework for the Internet of Things (FIoT), introduces our proposed\\nGPT-in-the-loop approach, presents comparative results in the IoT context, and\\nconcludes with insights and future directions.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Unleashing the Potential of LLMs for Quantum Computing: A Study in\\n  Quantum Architecture Design\\nSummary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute significantly to the development of\\nconversational AI and has great potentials to assist the scientific research in\\nvarious areas. This paper attempts to address the following questions: What\\nopportunities do the current generation of generative pre-trained transformers\\n(GPTs) offer for the developments of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\\ntechnologies? Additionally, what potentials does the forthcoming generation of\\nGPTs possess to push the frontier of research in fault-tolerant quantum\\ncomputing (FTQC)? In this paper, we implement a QGAS model, which can rapidly\\npropose promising ansatz architectures and evaluate them with application\\nbenchmarks including quantum chemistry and quantum finance tasks. Our results\\ndemonstrate that after a limited number of prompt guidelines and iterations, we\\ncan obtain a high-performance ansatz which is able to produce comparable\\nresults that are achieved by state-of-the-art quantum architecture search\\nmethods. This study provides a simple overview of GPT\\'s capabilities in\\nsupporting quantum computing research while highlighting the limitations of the\\ncurrent GPT at the same time. Additionally, we discuss futuristic applications\\nfor LLM in quantum research.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Can LLMs Capture Human Preferences?\\nSummary:   We explore the viability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically\\nOpenAI\\'s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in emulating human survey respondents and eliciting\\npreferences, with a focus on intertemporal choices. Leveraging the extensive\\nliterature on intertemporal discounting for benchmarking, we examine responses\\nfrom LLMs across various languages and compare them to human responses,\\nexploring preferences between smaller, sooner, and larger, later rewards. Our\\nfindings reveal that both GPT models demonstrate less patience than humans,\\nwith GPT-3.5 exhibiting a lexicographic preference for earlier rewards, unlike\\nhuman decision-makers. Though GPT-4 does not display lexicographic preferences,\\nits measured discount rates are still considerably larger than those found in\\nhumans. Interestingly, GPT models show greater patience in languages with weak\\nfuture tense references, such as German and Mandarin, aligning with existing\\nliterature that suggests a correlation between language structure and\\nintertemporal preferences. We demonstrate how prompting GPT to explain its\\ndecisions, a procedure we term \"chain-of-thought conjoint,\" can mitigate, but\\ndoes not eliminate, discrepancies between LLM and human responses. While\\ndirectly eliciting preferences using LLMs may yield misleading results,\\ncombining chain-of-thought conjoint with topic modeling aids in hypothesis\\ngeneration, enabling researchers to explore the underpinnings of preferences.\\nChain-of-thought conjoint provides a structured framework for marketers to use\\nLLMs to identify potential attributes or factors that can explain preference\\nheterogeneity across different customers and contexts.\\n\\n\\nTitle: DB-GPT-Hub: Towards Open Benchmarking Text-to-SQL Empowered by Large\\n  Language Models\\nSummary:   Large language models (LLMs) becomes the dominant paradigm for the\\nchallenging task of text-to-SQL. LLM-empowered text-to-SQL methods are\\ntypically categorized into prompting-based and tuning approaches. Compared to\\nprompting-based methods, benchmarking fine-tuned LLMs for text-to-SQL is\\nimportant yet under-explored, partially attributed to the prohibitively high\\ncomputational cost. In this paper, we present DB-GPT-Hub, an open benchmark\\nsuite for LLM-empowered text-to-SQL, which primarily focuses on tuning LLMs at\\nlarge scales. The proposed benchmark consists of: 1. a standardized and\\ncomprehensive evaluation of text-to-SQL tasks by fine-tuning medium to\\nlarge-sized open LLMs; 2. a modularized and easy-to-extend codebase with\\nmainstream LLMs and experimental scenarios supported, which prioritizes\\nfine-tuning methods but can be easily extended to prompt-based setting. Our\\nwork investigates the potential gains and the performance boundaries of tuning\\napproaches, compared to prompting approaches and explores optimal solutions\\ntailored to specific scenarios. We hope DB-GPT-Hub, along with these findings,\\nenables further research and broad applications that would otherwise be\\ndifficult owing to the absence of a dedicated open benchmark. The project code\\nhas been released at https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT-Hub.\\n\\n\\nTitle: GPT-NER: Named Entity Recognition via Large Language Models\\nSummary:   Despite the fact that large-scale Language Models (LLM) have achieved SOTA\\nperformances on a variety of NLP tasks, its performance on NER is still\\nsignificantly below supervised baselines. This is due to the gap between the\\ntwo tasks the NER and LLMs: the former is a sequence labeling task in nature\\nwhile the latter is a text-generation model.\\n  In this paper, we propose GPT-NER to resolve this issue. GPT-NER bridges the\\ngap by transforming the sequence labeling task to a generation task that can be\\neasily adapted by LLMs e.g., the task of finding location entities in the input\\ntext \"Columbus is a city\" is transformed to generate the text sequence\\n\"@@Columbus## is a city\", where special tokens @@## marks the entity to\\nextract. To efficiently address the \"hallucination\" issue of LLMs, where LLMs\\nhave a strong inclination to over-confidently label NULL inputs as entities, we\\npropose a self-verification strategy by prompting LLMs to ask itself whether\\nthe extracted entities belong to a labeled entity tag.\\n  We conduct experiments on five widely adopted NER datasets, and GPT-NER\\nachieves comparable performances to fully supervised baselines, which is the\\nfirst time as far as we are concerned. More importantly, we find that GPT-NER\\nexhibits a greater ability in the low-resource and few-shot setups, when the\\namount of training data is extremely scarce, GPT-NER performs significantly\\nbetter than supervised models. This demonstrates the capabilities of GPT-NER in\\nreal-world NER applications where the number of labeled examples is limited.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Unleashing GPT on the Metaverse: Savior or Destroyer?\\nSummary:   Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly large\\nlanguage models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly vital for developing immersive\\nand interactive metaverse experiences. GPT, a representative LLM developed by\\nOpenAI, is leading LLM development and gaining attention for its potential in\\nbuilding the metaverse. The article delves into the pros and cons of utilizing\\nGPT for metaverse-based education, entertainment, personalization, and support.\\nDynamic and personalized experiences are possible with this technology, but\\nthere are also legitimate privacy, bias, and ethical issues to consider. This\\narticle aims to help readers understand the possible influence of GPT,\\naccording to its unique technological advantages, on the metaverse and how it\\nmay be used to effectively create a more immersive and engaging virtual\\nenvironment by evaluating these opportunities and obstacles.\\n\\n\\nTitle: The Dawn of LMMs: Preliminary Explorations with GPT-4V(ision)\\nSummary:   Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with\\nmulti-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic\\nintelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to\\ndeepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks\\nthat GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and\\ngenericity of GPT-4V\\'s capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes,\\nand the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring\\nGPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative\\nsamples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these\\nsamples demonstrate that GPT-4V\\'s unprecedented ability in processing\\narbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its\\ncapabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system.\\nFurthermore, GPT-4V\\'s unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn\\non input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as\\nvisual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on\\nthe emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for\\nGPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire\\nfuture research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to\\nexploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better\\nunderstanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the\\nmodel under our study is solely the product of OpenAI\\'s innovative work, and\\nthey should be fully credited for its development.

Pain points in writing property-based tests include implementing\\ndiverse random input generators and thinking of meaningful properties to test.\\nDevelopers, however, are more amenable to writing documentation; plenty of\\nlibrary API documentation is available and can be used as natural language\\nspecifications for property-based tests. As large language models (LLMs) have\\nrecently shown promise in a variety of coding tasks, we explore the potential\\nof using LLMs to synthesize property-based tests. We call our approach PBT-GPT,\\nand propose three different strategies of prompting the LLM for PBT. We\\ncharacterize various failure modes of PBT-GPT and detail an evaluation\\nmethodology for automatically synthesized property-based tests. PBT-GPT\\nachieves promising results in our preliminary studies on sample Python library\\nAPIs in $\\\\texttt{numpy}$, $\\\\texttt{networkx}$, and $\\\\texttt{datetime}$.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Connecting the Dots: Evaluating Abstract Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs\\n  Using the New York Times Connections Word Game\\nSummary:   The New York Times Connections game has emerged as a popular and challenging\\npursuit for word puzzle enthusiasts. We collect 200 Connections games to\\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)\\nagainst expert and novice human players. Our results show that even the\\nbest-performing LLM, GPT-4o, which has otherwise shown impressive reasoning\\nabilities on a wide variety of benchmarks, can only fully solve 8% of the\\ngames. Compared to GPT-4o, novice and expert players perform better, with\\nexpert human players significantly outperforming GPT-4o. To deepen our\\nunderstanding we create a taxonomy of the knowledge types required to\\nsuccessfully categorize words in the Connections game, revealing that LLMs\\nstruggle with associative, encyclopedic, and linguistic knowledge. Our findings\\nestablish the New York Times Connections game as a challenging benchmark for\\nevaluating abstract reasoning capabilities in humans and AI systems.\\n\\n\\nTitle: The Shifted and The Overlooked: A Task-oriented Investigation of\\n  User-GPT Interactions\\nSummary:   Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has produced models that\\nexhibit remarkable performance across a variety of NLP tasks. However, it\\nremains unclear whether the existing focus of NLP research accurately captures\\nthe genuine requirements of human users. This paper provides a comprehensive\\nanalysis of the divergence between current NLP research and the needs of\\nreal-world NLP applications via a large-scale collection of user-GPT\\nconversations. We analyze a large-scale collection of real user queries to GPT.\\nWe compare these queries against existing NLP benchmark tasks and identify a\\nsignificant gap between the tasks that users frequently request from LLMs and\\nthe tasks that are commonly studied in academic research. For example, we find\\nthat tasks such as ``design\\'\\' and ``planning\\'\\' are prevalent in user\\ninteractions but are largely neglected or different from traditional NLP\\nbenchmarks. We investigate these overlooked tasks, dissect the practical\\nchallenges they pose, and provide insights toward a roadmap to make LLMs better\\naligned with user needs.\\n\\n\\nTitle: Automated Claim Matching with Large Language Models: Empowering\\n  Fact-Checkers in the Fight Against Misinformation\\nSummary:   In today\\'s digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation poses threats to\\npublic well-being and societal trust. As online misinformation proliferates,\\nmanual verification by fact checkers becomes increasingly challenging. We\\nintroduce FACT-GPT (Fact-checking Augmentation with Claim matching\\nTask-oriented Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a framework designed to\\nautomate the claim matching phase of fact-checking using Large Language Models\\n(LLMs). This framework identifies new social media content that either supports\\nor contradicts claims previously debunked by fact-checkers. Our approach\\nemploys GPT-4 to generate a labeled dataset consisting of simulated social\\nmedia posts. This data set serves as a training ground for fine-tuning more\\nspecialized LLMs. We evaluated FACT-GPT on an extensive dataset of social media\\ncontent related to public health. The results indicate that our fine-tuned LLMs\\nrival the performance of larger pre-trained LLMs in claim matching tasks,\\naligning closely with human annotations.
